An ocean wave associated with it injured a father and his son at Barnegat Inlet (Ocean County). The tidal departure caused by the meteotsunami ranged from three inches to one foot along the New Jersey coast, but some rough surf and higher waves occurred at the time of its occurrence.||The meteotsunami was believed induced by a weak end derecho that moved off the New Jersey coast at about 11 a.m. EDT on the morning of the 13th. The surface pressure fluctuation caused by this phenomenon was believed to have triggered it. The worst reported incident with the meteotsunami occurred in Ocean County at Barnegat Inlet at around 330 p.m. EDT on the 13th. A man was spear fishing near the mouth of Barnegat Inlet, just south of a submerged northern breakwater.  The outgoing tide (high tide was at about Noon EDT) was amplified by strong currents which carried divers over the submerged breakwater (normally 3-4 feet deep). This strong outrush continued for about two minutes and eventually the rocks in the submerged breakwater were exposed.  At this point, the eyewitness noticed a large wave coming in, approximately six feet peak-to-trough and spanned across the inlet. The upper two feet of the wave was breaking. This wave occurred in conjunction with a reversal of the current such that even though the tide was receding, a strong surge was entering the inlet. This surge carried the divers back over the submerged reef and into the inlet from where they were rescued. On the south jetty, three people were swept off the rocks which were 5 to 6 feet above sea level at the time into the ocean on the beach side of the jetty.
