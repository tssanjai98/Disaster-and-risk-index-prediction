The heavy rains produced the worst flood on record along the Stehekin River near the town of Stehekin. While there is no official flood stage on the Stehekin River, the river rose 13 feet by early morning October 21st. Four homes were lost and 10 to 20 were damaged. The flood extensively damaged the park infrastructure of the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. Hundreds of trees were washed down the river valley and deposited in the northern reaches of Lake Chelan.  The village of Holden, in the mountains south of Lake Chelan, suffered damage as a result of mud slides and swollen feeder streams.

The last in a series of strong, early season storms brought record heavy rain to the coast and valleys, and dumped two feet of snow at the mountain resorts. This storm sent October rainfall totals to record levels in most locations, and brought a quick end to what could have been another disasterous fire season. San Diego Lindbergh Field ended October with 4.98 inches of rain, making it the wettest October since records began in 1850. Many ski resorts in the San Bernardino Mountains were open by Halloween...something that hadn't happened in over 30 years. The storm caused widespread urban flooding and sent mud and rocks sliding down hillsides and canyons all across the area. Strong thunderstorms also raked across Orange and San Diego counties, bringing even more heavy rain, small hail, and gusty winds. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 2.00 to 4.00 inches or more from the coast to the mountains, and between 0.50 to 1.00 inch in the deserts. As a result, October rainfall totals ended between 1000% and 2000% above normal in the coast, valley, and desert locations, and between 500% to 900% above normal in the mountains.",179

The slide zone covered a stretch of Interstate 70 about 100 feet in length and 10 feet deep. According to the Colorado Department of Transportation, two bridges received holes in their decking on eastbound I-70. About six boulders were embedded up to eight feet into the roadway. The rocks fell from about 1,300 feet above the highway, leaving gaping holes up to 25 feet wide and 10 feet long in the westbound lanes. Cracks in the highway were also visible, stretching up to 20 feet from the edge of the mammoth holes. Some boulders had to be blasted apart before front-end loaders could remove them from the highway. One eastbound and one westbound lane were opened the following day. At a construction cost of 1.4 million dollars, repairs were expected to take several months.  There were no injuries, mainly due to the fact that the interstate highway in that area just happened to be closed when the rockslide occurred.

An active round of severe weather affected portions of west Texas during the afternoon and evening of the 14th. By mid afternoon, a large outflow boundary was stretched from the Davis Mountains northeastward across the Permian Basin. While the dominant convective mode was multicellular clusters, a few storms obtained supercellular characteristics. The initial storm that developed along the boundary over the southern Permian Basin quickly became a supercell, and produced golfball size hail and funnel clouds.

Additional storms over the Trans Pecos region produced large hail up to the size of golfballs, damaging wind gusts, and flash flooding. A motorist on Interstate 10 reported that large hail broke a vehicle windshield in western Pecos County. Apparent downbursts resulted in damage to light structures near Pecos and Mentone.",287

Southeast Alaska was at the end of a 'firehose' of tropical moisture.  This also correlated with the MJO at the time.  

Some historic seven day precipitation records were set:  Juneau International Airport 10.42" ending on 11/22...Juneau Lena Point 9.17" ending on 11/22...Downtown Juneau 15.11" ending on 11/23...Juneau Forecast Office 10.33" ending on 11/23...Haines coop observer (downtown) 12.16" ending on 11/25...Sitka International Airport 12.58" ending on 11/23...Hoonah coop 10.12" ending on 11/25...and the Pelican coop 26.87" ending on 11/23.  Juneau (airport dating back to 1943) experienced it's 3rd wettest day in history (3.45" on 11/21).  Sitka (airport dating back to 1900) experienced their 6th wettest day in history (4.74" on 11/22).  Pelican (dating back to 1967) and Wrangell had their wettest days in history (8.41" on 11/19 and 5.08" on 11/22 respectively).  

Disaster declarations were made in the communities of Juneau, Haines, Sitka, Hoonah and Pelican totaling over $4 million.  Early November high elevation snowpack ran-off during the warm up and helped contribute to the problems.  As is typical during these extended periods of heavy rainfall in Southeast Alaska, the steep mountain slopes that run off into the channels experienced numerous landslides.  Several homes were damaged by these landslides in the Juneau and Haines areas.  Streams and creeks swelled to bankfull levels, though no river flooding was reported.   Backed up culverts caused erosion beneath roadways.  Major damage occurred on the Haines road system due to this type of erosion.  Flooded basements were also reported in many areas.  Winds associated with the frontal passages complicated matters and caused widespread treefall throughout the Tongass National Forest.  Numerous power outages were reported as well.",313
