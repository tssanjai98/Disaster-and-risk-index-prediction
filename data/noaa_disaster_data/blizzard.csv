In general, snow totals ranged from 20 inches on the coastal plain (VAZ052>53; 055>057) to over 3 feet at the higher elevations of the central and northern Shenandoah Valley.  To complicate matters, winds gusting in excess of 35 mph produced drifts of 4 to 7 feet, except over 10 feet in the mountains.  The storm produced the largest statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Washington/Dulles airport (IAD; VAZ042) accumulated 24.6 inches., 19.8 of which fell on the 8th.  The 19.8 inches broke the all-time 24-hour accumulation record by 4.4 inches.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, as  snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  By the 8th, major interstate highways were open statewide; however, 75-100% of state and local highways remained impassible.  Highway clean-up and repair costs were remarkable across northern Virginia.  An estimated $50 million was spent on snow removal alone.  Repairs to pavement, guardrails, and side banks were estimated between $5 and $7 million.

Prior to the onset of precipitation, the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire Commonwealth.  This allowed for quick deployment of Virginia National Guardsmen, primarily from the Piedmont through the western highlands.  HMMWV's (Humvees) were dispatched to the region, and proved very effective in moving the medically impaired to area hospitals.  Despite the Guard's help, important services were significantly reduced; food, fuel, and medical supplies began to dry up.  All federal, state, and local governments, as well as all area school districts, were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th); most school districts remained closed for the entire week.

One person perished from exposure (VAZ053) the day after the storm ended (January 9th); ten others perished as a result of heart failure while shoveling snow.  Dozens of hikers and outdoorsmen were stranded in the Shenandoah Valley during the height of the blizzard.  Virtually all made it to prefabricated shelters in the park, where food and blankets were airlifted for several days until nearby roads could be cleared.  Statewide, 800 persons required shelter during the storm, the majority of whom were stranded travelers. 

The combination of powdery snow and moderate winds did not allow significant accumulations on trees or power lines; thus outages were minimal.  The only substantial damage was noted near Stanardsville (VAZ038), where 51 power poles were damaged or destroyed during the storm.

The weight of the snow on roofs, especially where drifts formed, caused scattered collapses across the area.  Many of the reported collapses were to structures unable to support the snow pack.  Such structures included greenhouses, poultry houses, porches and awnings, and a few mobile homes.  A man was injured when a greenhouse collapsed on him in Stephens City (VAZ031).  Most of the damage was reported in the Shenandoah Valley.  Noteworthy damage was reported to a church gymnasium in West Springfield, causing thousands of dollars in damage.  In Dale City (VAZ052), the Potomac Mills shopping mall remained closed for several days after the blizzard due to a large area of sagging roof which required extensive repair.  In Clarke Co (VAZ031), one barn collapsed.  In Burke (VAZ053), a fire began in a high school theater when a roof collapsed onto a natural gas line.  The blaze caused $8000 in damage.",1

The storm produced the largest statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Washington/Dulles airport (IAD; VAZ042) accumulated 24.6 inches., 19.8 of which fell on the 8th.  The 19.8 inches broke the all-time 24-hour accumulation record by 4.4 inches.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, as  snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  By the 8th, major interstate highways were open statewide; however, 75-100% of state and local highways remained impassible.  Highway clean-up and repair costs were remarkable across northern Virginia.  An estimated $50 million was spent on snow removal alone.  Repairs to pavement, guardrails, and side banks were estimated between $5 and $7 million.

Prior to the onset of precipitation, the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire Commonwealth.  This allowed for quick deployment of Virginia National Guardsmen, primarily from the Piedmont through the western highlands.  HMMWV's (Humvees) were dispatched to the region, and proved very effective in moving the medically impaired to area hospitals.  Despite the Guard's help, important services were significantly reduced; food, fuel, and medical supplies began to dry up.  All federal, state, and local governments, as well as all area school districts, were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th); most school districts remained closed for the entire week.

One person perished from exposure (VAZ053) the day after the storm ended (January 9th); ten others perished as a result of heart failure while shoveling snow.  Dozens of hikers and outdoorsmen were stranded in the Shenandoah Valley during the height of the blizzard.  Virtually all made it to prefabricated shelters in the park, where food and blankets were airlifted for several days until nearby roads could be cleared.  Statewide, 800 persons required shelter during the storm, the majority of whom were stranded travelers. 

The combination of powdery snow and moderate winds did not allow significant accumulations on trees or power lines; thus outages were minimal.  The only substantial damage was noted near Stanardsville (VAZ038), where 51 power poles were damaged or destroyed during the storm.

The weight of the snow on roofs, especially where drifts formed, caused scattered collapses across the area.  Many of the reported collapses were to structures unable to support the snow pack.  Such structures included greenhouses, poultry houses, porches and awnings, and a few mobile homes.  A man was injured when a greenhouse collapsed on him in Stephens City (VAZ031).  Most of the damage was reported in the Shenandoah Valley.  Noteworthy damage was reported to a church gymnasium in West Springfield, causing thousands of dollars in damage.

Snow began around midnight on the 7th and became very heavy by the morning 7th.  Increasing northeast winds produced blizzard conditions in Cecil County and near blizzard conditions elsewhere along the Maryland Eastern Shore.  Warmer air above the ground helped change the snow to sleet across southern parts of the Eastern Shore and held down accumulations.  Accumulations averaged 12 to 18 inches in Talbot County, 12 to 24 inches in Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne's Counties and around 24 inches in Cecil County.  There was a lull in the precipitation for a while after midnight on the 8th, before a final parting shot came across the region that morning.

Prior to the onset of precipitation, the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire Commonwealth.  This allowed for quick deployment of Virginia National Guardsmen, primarily from the Piedmont through the western highlands.  HMMWV's (Humvees) were dispatched to the region, and proved very effective in moving the medically impaired to area hospitals.  Despite the Guard's help, important services were significantly reduced; food, fuel, and medical supplies began to dry up.  All federal, state, and local governments, as well as all area school districts, were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th); most school districts remained closed for the entire week.

One person perished from exposure (VAZ053) the day after the storm ended (January 9th); ten others perished as a result of heart failure while shoveling snow.  Dozens of hikers and outdoorsmen were stranded in the Shenandoah Valley during the height of the blizzard.  Virtually all made it to prefabricated shelters in the park, where food and blankets were airlifted for several days until nearby roads could be cleared.  Statewide, 800 persons required shelter during the storm, the majority of whom were stranded travelers. 

The combination of powdery snow and moderate winds did not allow significant accumulations on trees or power lines; thus outages were minimal.  The only substantial damage was noted near Stanardsville (VAZ038), where 51 power poles were damaged or destroyed during the storm.

The weight of the snow on roofs, especially where drifts formed, caused scattered collapses across the area.  Many of the reported collapses were to structures unable to support the snow pack.  Such structures included greenhouses, poultry houses, porches and awnings, and a few mobile homes.  A man was injured when a greenhouse collapsed on him in Stephens City (VAZ031).  Most of the damage was reported in the Shenandoah Valley.  Noteworthy damage was reported to a church gymnasium in West Springfield, causing thousands of dollars in damage.  In Dale City (VAZ052), the Potomac Mills shopping mall remained closed for several days after the blizzard due to a large area of sagging roof which required extensive repair.  In Clarke Co (VAZ031), one barn collapsed.  In Burke (VAZ053), a fire began in a high school theater when a roof collapsed onto a natural gas line.  The blaze caused $8000 in damage.",14

In general, snow totals ranged from 20 inches on the coastal plain (VAZ052>53; 055>057) to over 3 feet at the higher elevations of the central and northern Shenandoah Valley.  To complicate matters, winds gusting in excess of 35 mph produced drifts of 4 to 7 feet, except over 10 feet in the mountains.  The storm produced the largest statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Washington/Dulles airport (IAD; VAZ042) accumulated 24.6 inches., 19.8 of which fell on the 8th.  The 19.8 inches broke the all-time 24-hour accumulation record by 4.4 inches.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, as  snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  By the 8th, major interstate highways were open statewide; however, 75-100% of state and local highways remained impassible.

In general, snow totals were as follows: 20 inches in lower southern Maryland (MDZ016>018), 20 to 26 inches in central Maryland (MDZ009>011, 013), and 26 to 36 inches to over the northern tier (MDZ002>007).  To complicate matters, winds gusting in excess of 35 mph produced drifts of 4 to 7 feet, except over 10 feet in the mountains.  The storm produced the larges statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Baltimore/Washington International (BWI; MDZ011) nearly equalled its record of 22.8 inches in 24 hours (22.5 inches fell), set in 1983.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.

Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, but interstates were "open" by the 8th, even though snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  The Washington subway system suffered several above-ground mishaps in Maryland.  Shortly after the onset of the storm, a train, with three persons aboard (including the driver), slid into another in central Montgomery Co (MDZ009), killing the driver.  The follolwing evening, 80 passengers were stranded when a train got stuck between stations.  Many above-ground stations remained closed throughout the following work week.

Two persons perished directly from hypothermia the day after the blizzard.  Over 150 injuries were reported at area hospitals and clinics shortly after the blizzard, most due to over-exertion from shoveling snow, but some due to slipping on ice.

All federal, state, and local governments were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th).  Most school districts remained closed for the week.  A federal state of emergency was declared the following Friday (the 12th).  Snow removal/damage costs exceeded $70 million (state and county combined), a state record for an individual winter storm.  The vast majority was incurred by snow removal operations; another $3.7 million was budgeted for repairs to highways including potholes, guard rails, and side banks.

The weight of the snow caused several area roofs to collapse.  In Clinton (MDZ013), the roof of a nursing home dining room caved in at 0730 EST on the 8th, displacing up to 120 residents.  Fortunately, disaster was averted because breakfast was served in the dormitories rather than in the dining room due to staff shortages.  No injuries were reported.  In Frederick Co (MDZ004), a barn collapsed, killing 100 cows and injuring about 100 more.  Two barns collapsed in Clear Spring (MDZ003), and 100 cows escaped unharmed.",24

The 19.8 inches broke the all-time 24-hour accumulation record by 4.4 inches.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, as  snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  By the 8th, major interstate highways were open statewide; however, 75-100% of state and local highways remained impassible.  Highway clean-up and repair costs were remarkable across northern Virginia.  An estimated $50 million was spent on snow removal alone.  Repairs to pavement, guardrails, and side banks were estimated between $5 and $7 million.

Prior to the onset of precipitation, the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire Commonwealth.  This allowed for quick deployment of Virginia National Guardsmen, primarily from the Piedmont through the western highlands.  HMMWV's (Humvees) were dispatched to the region, and proved very effective in moving the medically impaired to area hospitals.  Despite the Guard's help, important services were significantly reduced; food, fuel, and medical supplies began to dry up.  All federal, state, and local governments, as well as all area school districts, were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th); most school districts remained closed for the entire week.

One person perished from exposure (VAZ053) the day after the storm ended (January 9th); ten others perished as a result of heart failure while shoveling snow.  Dozens of hikers and outdoorsmen were stranded in the Shenandoah Valley during the height of the blizzard.  Virtually all made it to prefabricated shelters in the park, where food and blankets were airlifted for several days until nearby roads could be cleared.  Statewide, 800 persons required shelter during the storm, the majority of whom were stranded travelers. 

The combination of powdery snow and moderate winds did not allow significant accumulations on trees or power lines; thus outages were minimal.  The only substantial damage was noted near Stanardsville (VAZ038), where 51 power poles were damaged or destroyed during the storm.

The weight of the snow on roofs, especially where drifts formed, caused scattered collapses across the area.  Many of the reported collapses were to structures unable to support the snow pack.  Such structures included greenhouses, poultry houses, porches and awnings, and a few mobile homes.  A man was injured when a greenhouse collapsed on him in Stephens City (VAZ031).  Most of the damage was reported in the Shenandoah Valley.  Noteworthy damage was reported to a church gymnasium in West Springfield, causing thousands of dollars in damage.  In Dale City (VAZ052), the Potomac Mills shopping mall remained closed for several days after the blizzard due to a large area of sagging roof which required extensive repair.  In Clarke Co (VAZ031), one barn collapsed.  In Burke (VAZ053), a fire began in a high school theater when a roof collapsed onto a natural gas line.  The blaze caused $8000 in damage.",25

Six persons died of hypothermia, 4 in Philadelphia, 1 in Delaware County and 1 in Lehigh County.  Some were homeless persons, but one woman in Allentown accidentally locked herself out of her home.  Twenty-nine persons suffered heart attacks and died while shoveling snow, using snowblowers or trying to walk in the deep snow.  A Delaware County man died of carbon monoxide poisoning after his vehicle's tail pipe was not cleared of snow.  Two persons in Philadelphia also died of carbon monoxide poisoning within their home.

Another Montgomery County man died while he was riding on an inner tube and slid underneath a parked vehicle.

The number of deaths and injuries was reduced by the storm starting before dawn on Sunday with blizzard conditions in full force by the early afternoon.

This was a classic a storm track for heavy snow.  Precipitation was all snow in Pennsylvania.  Snow began falling during the predawn hours on the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning.  Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low.  There was a lull in the precipitation after midnight on the 8th, before some wraparound snow returned during the daylight hours.

This was a very difficult snow to measure due to the strong winds and powdery nature of the snow.  All-time single storm records were set at both the Lehigh Valley International Airport (25.6 inches) and Philadelphia International Airport (30.7 inches).  It should be noted the 30.7 inches represents a SNOWFALL ESTIMATE.  Due to the considerable blowing and drifting of the snow, the observers at the airport were forced to use a water equivalent/snowfall estimate table.  The actual ACCUMULATION was probably less.  Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches in Monroe and Carbon Counties,  around 2 feet in Lehigh and Northampton Counties,  24 to 33 inches in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches in Montgomery and Bucks Counties and 27 inches in Philadelphia.  Other individual accumulations included 33 inches in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), 30 inches in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), 28 inches in Perkasie (Bucks), 27 inches in Philadelphia (Franklin Institute) and 26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester).

A state of emergency was declared on Sunday the 7th and wasn't lifted until 6 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.  The National Guard assisted the state with snow removals and rescues.  Four wheel drive vehicles were used to transport emergency personnel and patients.  Humvees were used to clear the larger drifts that reached as high as 15 feet in Chester County.  There was no postal deliveries on the 8th.  Some schools were closed the whole week.  All major airports were closed.  Philadelphia International had one runway open as of 6 pm on the 8th.  The Reading Regional Airport was reopened on Tuesday the 9th.  The snow was so deep on Philadelphia's side streets that plows were unable to go down them.  This problem also affected firefighters.  The blocked side streets helped contribute to a fire which cost two Philadelphia families their home.  Homeless shelters in Phialdelphia set a new record. 

The unprecedented snow also caused numerous building collapses throughout the area, especially in Berks County.

A state of emergency was declared on Sunday the 7th and wasn't lifted until 6 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.  The National Guard assisted the state with snow removals and rescues.  Four wheel drive vehicles were used to transport emergency personnel and patients.  Humvees were used to clear the larger drifts that reached as high as 15 feet in Chester County.

Six persons died of hypothermia, 4 in Philadelphia, 1 in Delaware County and 1 in Lehigh County.  Some were homeless persons, but one woman in Allentown accidentally locked herself out of her home.

Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low.  There was a lull in the precipitation after midnight on the 8th, before some wraparound snow returned during the daylight hours.

This was a very difficult snow to measure due to the strong winds and powdery nature of the snow.

In general, snow totals ranged from 28 to 36 inches at most locations in the Potomac Highlands and the eastern Panhandle.  Gusty winds produced drifts between 6 and 10 feet.  The storm produced the largest storm totals since the "Superstorm of March 12-14, 1993", which dumped similar amounts of snow across the region.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The follolwing evening, 80 passengers were stranded when a train got stuck between stations.  Many above-ground stations remained closed throughout the following work week.

Two persons perished directly from hypothermia the day after the blizzard.  Over 150 injuries were reported at area hospitals and clinics shortly after the blizzard, most due to over-exertion from shoveling snow, but some due to slipping on ice.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, but interstates were "open" by the 8th, even though snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  The Washington subway system suffered several above-ground mishaps in Maryland.  Shortly after the onset of the storm, a train, with three persons aboard (including the driver), slid into another in central Montgomery Co (MDZ009), killing the driver.  The follolwing evening, 80 passengers were stranded when a train got stuck between stations.  Many above-ground stations remained closed throughout the following work week.

Two persons perished directly from hypothermia the day after the blizzard.  Over 150 injuries were reported at area hospitals and clinics shortly after the blizzard, most due to over-exertion from shoveling snow, but some due to slipping on ice.

All federal, state, and local governments were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th).  Most school districts remained closed for the week.  A federal state of emergency was declared the following Friday (the 12th).  Snow removal/damage costs exceeded $70 million (state and county combined), a state record for an individual winter storm.  The vast majority was incurred by snow removal operations; another $3.7 million was budgeted for repairs to highways including potholes, guard rails, and side banks.

The weight of the snow caused several area roofs to collapse.  In Clinton (MDZ013), the roof of a nursing home dining room caved in at 0730 EST on the 8th, displacing up to 120 residents.  Fortunately, disaster was averted because breakfast was served in the dormitories rather than in the dining room due to staff shortages.  No injuries were reported.  In Frederick Co (MDZ004), a barn collapsed, killing 100 cows and injuring about 100 more.  Two barns collapsed in Clear Spring (MDZ003), and 100 cows escaped unharmed.",47

In general, snow totals ranged from 17.1 inches at Washington/National airport (DCA) to 21 inches in Northwest Washington.  Gusty winds produced drifts to 5 feet in some places.  The storm produced the largest storm total since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England.  For the city as a whole, the storm ranked 4th all-time; for modern records (taken at DCA), the storm ranked 2nd, with only the "Presidents Day" storm of February 18th-19th, 1979, dumping more (18.7 inches).

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

All major highways were effectively closed through the 7th, as snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  However, residential areas remained unplowed for up to one week following the storm; FEMA provided funding for additional snow removal equipment to clear the streets by the weekend of the 13th/14th.  Subway transit was impacted as well, as the Washington subway system was effectively shut down through Tuesday, and above-ground stations opened sporadically throughout the following work week.  The combination of warming temperatures and concerted snow removal efforts opened all roads by the 17th.

All federal, state, and local governments, as well as public schools, wer closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th).  Road damage - especially from potholes and related pavement failures - was excessive.  Estimated commercial losses to the northeastern U.S. for the week of January 7-13 were between $7 and $10 billion - this on top of a sluggish holiday season and federal government shutdowns.",48

In general, snow totals ranged from 20 inches on the coastal plain (VAZ052>53; 055>057) to over 3 feet at the higher elevations of the central and northern Shenandoah Valley.  To complicate matters, winds gusting in excess of 35 mph produced drifts of 4 to 7 feet, except over 10 feet in the mountains.  The storm produced the largest statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Washington/Dulles airport (IAD; VAZ042) accumulated 24.6 inches., 19.8 of which fell on the 8th.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, as  snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  By the 8th, major interstate highways were open statewide; however, 75-100% of state and local highways remained impassible.  Highway clean-up and repair costs were remarkable across northern Virginia.  An estimated $50 million was spent on snow removal alone.  Repairs to pavement, guardrails, and side banks were estimated between $5 and $7 million.

Prior to the onset of precipitation, the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire Commonwealth.  This allowed for quick deployment of Virginia National Guardsmen, primarily from the Piedmont through the western highlands.  HMMWV's (Humvees) were dispatched to the region, and proved very effective in moving the medically impaired to area hospitals.  Despite the Guard's help, important services were significantly reduced; food, fuel, and medical supplies began to dry up.  All federal, state, and local governments, as well as all area school districts, were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th); most school districts remained closed for the entire week.

One person perished from exposure (VAZ053) the day after the storm ended (January 9th); ten others perished as a result of heart failure while shoveling snow.  Dozens of hikers and outdoorsmen were stranded in the Shenandoah Valley during the height of the blizzard.  Virtually all made it to prefabricated shelters in the park, where food and blankets were airlifted for several days until nearby roads could be cleared.  Statewide, 800 persons required shelter during the storm, the majority of whom were stranded travelers. 

The combination of powdery snow and moderate winds did not allow significant accumulations on trees or power lines; thus outages were minimal.  The only substantial damage was noted near Stanardsville (VAZ038), where 51 power poles were damaged or destroyed during the storm.

The weight of the snow on roofs, especially where drifts formed, caused scattered collapses across the area.  Many of the reported collapses were to structures unable to support the snow pack.  Such structures included greenhouses, poultry houses, porches and awnings, and a few mobile homes.  A man was injured when a greenhouse collapsed on him in Stephens City (VAZ031).  Most of the damage was reported in the Shenandoah Valley.  Noteworthy damage was reported to a church gymnasium in West Springfield, causing thousands of dollars in damage.  In Dale City (VAZ052), the Potomac Mills shopping mall remained closed for several days after the blizzard due to a large area of sagging roof which required extensive repair.

This was a classic a storm track for heavy snow.  Precipitation was all snow in Pennsylvania.  Snow began falling during the predawn hours on the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning.  Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low.  There was a lull in the precipitation after midnight on the 8th, before some wraparound snow returned during the daylight hours.

This was a very difficult snow to measure due to the strong winds and powdery nature of the snow.  All-time single storm records were set at both the Lehigh Valley International Airport (25.6 inches) and Philadelphia International Airport (30.7 inches).  It should be noted the 30.7 inches represents a SNOWFALL ESTIMATE.  Due to the considerable blowing and drifting of the snow, the observers at the airport were forced to use a water equivalent/snowfall estimate table.  The actual ACCUMULATION was probably less.  Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches in Monroe and Carbon Counties,  around 2 feet in Lehigh and Northampton Counties,  24 to 33 inches in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches in Montgomery and Bucks Counties and 27 inches in Philadelphia.  Other individual accumulations included 33 inches in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), 30 inches in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), 28 inches in Perkasie (Bucks), 27 inches in Philadelphia (Franklin Institute) and 26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester).

A state of emergency was declared on Sunday the 7th and wasn't lifted until 6 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.  The National Guard assisted the state with snow removals and rescues.  Four wheel drive vehicles were used to transport emergency personnel and patients.  Humvees were used to clear the larger drifts that reached as high as 15 feet in Chester County.

The storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico  on the morning of the 6th, moved south of Alabama the evening of the 6th, reached Savannah Georgia the morning of the 7th, Cape Hatteras the evening of the 7th, moved just to the west of the Delaware Bay Buoy the morning of the 8th before reaching the Southern New England Coastal Waters the evening of the 8th.  This was a classic a storm track for heavy snow.  Precipitation was all snow in Pennsylvania.  Snow began falling during the predawn hours on the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning.  Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low.  There was a lull in the precipitation after midnight on the 8th, before some wraparound snow returned during the daylight hours.

This was a very difficult snow to measure due to the strong winds and powdery nature of the snow.  All-time single storm records were set at both the Lehigh Valley International Airport (25.6 inches) and Philadelphia International Airport (30.7 inches).  It should be noted the 30.7 inches represents a SNOWFALL ESTIMATE.  Due to the considerable blowing and drifting of the snow, the observers at the airport were forced to use a water equivalent/snowfall estimate table.  The actual ACCUMULATION was probably less.  Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches in Monroe and Carbon Counties,  around 2 feet in Lehigh and Northampton Counties,  24 to 33 inches in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches in Montgomery and Bucks Counties and 27 inches in Philadelphia.  Other individual accumulations included 33 inches in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), 30 inches in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), 28 inches in Perkasie (Bucks), 27 inches in Philadelphia (Franklin Institute) and 26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester).

A state of emergency was declared on Sunday the 7th and wasn't lifted until 6 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.  The National Guard assisted the state with snow removals and rescues.  Four wheel drive vehicles were used to transport emergency personnel and patients.  Humvees were used to clear the larger drifts that reached as high as 15 feet in Chester County.  There was no postal deliveries on the 8th.  Some schools were closed the whole week.  All major airports were closed.  Philadelphia International had one runway open as of 6 pm on the 8th.  The Reading Regional Airport was reopened on Tuesday the 9th.  The snow was so deep on Philadelphia's side streets that plows were unable to go down them.  This problem also affected firefighters.  The blocked side streets helped contribute to a fire which cost two Philadelphia families their home.  Homeless shelters in Phialdelphia set a new record. 

The unprecedented snow also caused numerous building collapses throughout the area, especially in Berks County.  Some of the worse ones included the Atlas Roofing Company in Richland Township (Bucks County), the East Penn Manufacturing Company near Lyons (Berks County) and the Penn Crest Gardens Apartments in South Whitehall Township (Lehigh County).  Thirty-five residents were evacuated from one building after the roof buckled.",54

Six persons died of hypothermia, 4 in Philadelphia, 1 in Delaware County and 1 in Lehigh County.  Some were homeless persons, but one woman in Allentown accidentally locked herself out of her home.  Twenty-nine persons suffered heart attacks and died while shoveling snow, using snowblowers or trying to walk in the deep snow.

The Washington subway system suffered several above-ground mishaps in Maryland.  Shortly after the onset of the storm, a train, with three persons aboard (including the driver), slid into another in central Montgomery Co (MDZ009), killing the driver.

In general, snow totals were as follows: 20 inches in lower southern Maryland (MDZ016>018), 20 to 26 inches in central Maryland (MDZ009>011, 013), and 26 to 36 inches to over the northern tier (MDZ002>007).  To complicate matters, winds gusting in excess of 35 mph produced drifts of 4 to 7 feet, except over 10 feet in the mountains.  The storm produced the larges statewide storm totals since the "Megalopolitan Storm" of February 11th, 1983.  Numerous 24-hour accumulation records were shattered at airports from southwest Virginia through New England; Baltimore/Washington International (BWI; MDZ011) nearly equalled its record of 22.8 inches in 24 hours (22.5 inches fell), set in 1983.

The storm was induced by a digging upper level trough over the eastern Great Plains.  At the surface, an inverted trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South.  Surface pressures began falling as the upper trough approached on the afternoon of the 7th.  Meanwhile, confluent flow, behind an upper-level arctic vortex over the Canadian Maritimes, maintained strong (1034 mb) surface high pressure over northern New York state.  As the upper-level trough approached the southeast U.S. on the 8th, a new surface low developed along the Georgia coast.  The low deepened explosively while the arctic high remained in place.  Copious Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture was entrained into the system, producing heavy snow; the increasing gradient between the intensifying low and the arctic high caused winds to strengthen to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

The system moved slowly from South Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay overnight on the 7th.  The slow movement prolonged near-blizzard conditions into the 8th.  The storm finally moved towards New England later on the 8th, ending the snow but maintaining gusty north winds (and substantial blowing and drifting snow) until evening.

The storm effectively closed all major highways on the 7th, but interstates were "open" by the 8th, even though snow removal equipment fought a losing battle with the considerable blowing and drifting snow.  The Washington subway system suffered several above-ground mishaps in Maryland.  Shortly after the onset of the storm, a train, with three persons aboard (including the driver), slid into another in central Montgomery Co (MDZ009), killing the driver.  The follolwing evening, 80 passengers were stranded when a train got stuck between stations.  Many above-ground stations remained closed throughout the following work week.

Two persons perished directly from hypothermia the day after the blizzard.  Over 150 injuries were reported at area hospitals and clinics shortly after the blizzard, most due to over-exertion from shoveling snow, but some due to slipping on ice.

All federal, state, and local governments were closed Monday (the 8th) and Tuesday (the 9th).  Most school districts remained closed for the week.  A federal state of emergency was declared the following Friday (the 12th).  Snow removal/damage costs exceeded $70 million (state and county combined), a state record for an individual winter storm.  The vast majority was incurred by snow removal operations; another $3.7 million was budgeted for repairs to highways including potholes, guard rails, and side banks.

The weight of the snow caused several area roofs to collapse.  In Clinton (MDZ013), the roof of a nursing home dining room caved in at 0730 EST on the 8th, displacing up to 120 residents.  Fortunately, disaster was averted because breakfast was served in the dormitories rather than in the dining room due to staff shortages.  No injuries were reported.

Six persons died of hypothermia, 4 in Philadelphia, 1 in Delaware County and 1 in Lehigh County.  Some were homeless persons, but one woman in Allentown accidentally locked herself out of her home.  Twenty-nine persons suffered heart attacks and died while shoveling snow, using snowblowers or trying to walk in the deep snow.  A Delaware County man died of carbon monoxide poisoning after his vehicle's tail pipe was not cleared of snow.  Two persons in Philadelphia also died of carbon monoxide poisoning within their home.  A snow-blocked fire hydrant contributed to the death of one person in a Bucks County fire.  A Montgomery County man crashed and died in Upper Dublin Township on Pennsylvania State Route 309 when his vehicle struck an overpass.  Another Montgomery County man died while he was riding on an inner tube and slid underneath a parked vehicle.  The weight of the snow caused the collapse of a greenhouse in Exeter Township and killed one man.  

The number of deaths and injuries was reduced by the storm starting before dawn on Sunday with blizzard conditions in full force by the early afternoon.  The storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico  on the morning of the 6th, moved south of Alabama the evening of the 6th, reached Savannah Georgia the morning of the 7th, Cape Hatteras the evening of the 7th, moved just to the west of the Delaware Bay Buoy the morning of the 8th before reaching the Southern New England Coastal Waters the evening of the 8th.  This was a classic a storm track for heavy snow.  Precipitation was all snow in Pennsylvania.  Snow began falling during the predawn hours on the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning.  Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low.  There was a lull in the precipitation after midnight on the 8th, before some wraparound snow returned during the daylight hours.

This was a very difficult snow to measure due to the strong winds and powdery nature of the snow.  All-time single storm records were set at both the Lehigh Valley International Airport (25.6 inches) and Philadelphia International Airport (30.7 inches).  It should be noted the 30.7 inches represents a SNOWFALL ESTIMATE.  Due to the considerable blowing and drifting of the snow, the observers at the airport were forced to use a water equivalent/snowfall estimate table.  The actual ACCUMULATION was probably less.  Snowfall accumulations averaged 20 to 22 inches in Monroe and Carbon Counties,  around 2 feet in Lehigh and Northampton Counties,  24 to 33 inches in Berks County, 20 to 26 inches in Chester and Delaware Counties, 20 to 30 inches in Montgomery and Bucks Counties and 27 inches in Philadelphia.  Other individual accumulations included 33 inches in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), 30 inches in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), 28 inches in Perkasie (Bucks), 27 inches in Philadelphia (Franklin Institute) and 26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester).

A state of emergency was declared on Sunday the 7th and wasn't lifted until 6 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.  The National Guard assisted the state with snow removals and rescues.  Four wheel drive vehicles were used to transport emergency personnel and patients.  Humvees were used to clear the larger drifts that reached as high as 15 feet in Chester County.  There was no postal deliveries on the 8th.  Some schools were closed the whole week.  All major airports were closed.  Philadelphia International had one runway open as of 6 pm on the 8th.  The Reading Regional Airport was reopened on Tuesday the 9th.  The snow was so deep on Philadelphia's side streets that plows were unable to go down them.  This problem also affected firefighters.  The blocked side streets helped contribute to a fire which cost two Philadelphia families their home.  Homeless shelters in Phialdelphia set a new record. 

The unprecedented snow also caused numerous building collapses throughout the area, especially in Berks County.  Some of the worse ones included the Atlas Roofing Company in Richland Township (Bucks County), the East Penn Manufacturing Company near Lyons (Berks County) and the Penn Crest Gardens Apartments in South Whitehall Township (Lehigh County).  Thirty-five residents were evacuated from one building after the roof buckled.",65
