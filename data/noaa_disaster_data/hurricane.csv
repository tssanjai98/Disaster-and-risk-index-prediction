The center of the storm moved across Fort Morgan and into Mobile Bay during the early morning hours on Saturday. The storm remained nearly stationary over Mobile Bay for  eight hours.  Danny then creeped east, making landfall at Mullet Point, near Weeks Bay during the afternoon.  The storm continued moving slowly east across Baldwin county reaching Orange Beach during the evening.  Danny then drifted north along the Alabama and Florida border,  weakening to a depression near Walnut Hill Florida late Sunday morning.  Danny continued to drift north and passed through and out of Clarke county during the day Monday.  
Torrential rainfall fell generally along and south of I-10 in Mobile and Baldwin counties and throughout the central and south parts of Choctaw county.  The heaviest convection around Danny  shifted from the east to the west side of the storm while the center was over Mobile Bay. WSR-88D estimated an incredible 43 inches of  storm total rain over the open water in Mobile Bay.  Observing sites reported from 30 to 40 inches across the area with Dauphin Island reporting 36.71 inches with 25.98 inches of this falling between 5 PM and midnight on Saturday.  Unofficial estimates of 35 to 40 inches of rainfall were reported near the center of Danny as the storm moved across Weeks Bay.  As a result of the deluge, numerous roads were inundated and impassable for days. Record flooding caused major damage to homes along the Fowl River in Mobile county and the Fish river in Baldwin county.  A gauge site on the Fowl river at Laurendine Road recorded a height of 12.6 feet which is 1.5 times higher than the 100 year flood. At a gauge site on the Fish River near Silverhill a height of 22.8 feet was recorded, making this a 50 year flood event.  However, residents who have lived along the lower half of the Fish River for years, said this was the highest they had ever seen the river.  One reason for this,  was the heaviest rains fell south of the Silverhill gauging site.  More than 100 people had to be evacuated from their homes on Sunday as the Fish River overflowed its banks.  In Mobile county...Most of the roads on Dauphin Island were covered with more than a foot of water.  A CSX railroad trestle was undermined by flooding and collapsed at US HWY 90 and Ramsey Road.  In Baldwin county...numerous roads south of US HWY 98 and along roads near the Fish River were inundated and impassable for days.  
It was estimated that 80 percent of the Alabama public oyster reefs in Mobile county and 60 percent of the reefs in Baldwin county were destroyed and will take approximately 2 years to rebuild.  
Along the eastern shore, from Fairhope to Spanish Fort, heavy rains caused land slides and a few homes were teetering on the edge of Mobile Bay.  One home had to be relocated away from the edge of the Bay to prevent loss.  A 300 foot long sediment blockage, standing 6 feet high and 2 feet below the water, marooned up to 350 boats along the eastern shore marina slips.  For some of the marinas, the channels had to be redredged before boats could move in and out.   
On the east end of Dauphin Island, highest wind gusts were reported just over 100 mph with sustained winds of 70 to 80 mph. While inland at Mobile Regional Airport,  winds gusted to 45 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.  Wind gusts from Fort Morgan to Orange Beach were estimated at 80 to 100 mph.  Most homes and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings along the western shore of Mobile Bay and homes from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach sustained some type of roof damage.  Many homes in this area, with Gabled roofs, also suffered water damage as persistent winds blew rain into the attic through the vents in the ends of the homes.  A multi-story condominium under construction, near Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores, collapsed.  Numerous pecan and pine trees were blown over in the coastal areas of southwest Alabama with most extensive damage being in Baldwin county from Fairhope to Weeks Bay.  It was estimated that 70 percent of the Mobile pecan crop and 60 percent of the Baldwin crop for 1997 was lost.  High winds caused a  ferry, docked at Fort Gaines, to break away from its moorings on Saturday morning.  The runaway ferry destroyed the catwalk from the Dauphin Island weather observation platform.  The ferry wandered through the entrance of Mobile Bay coming to rest in a marsh near Gulf Shores.  
The state docks on the Mobile River recorded a low tide of -2 feet.  Most of the water was blown out by the storm Saturday morning for several hours. People observing the bay said they had never seen it so low.  Except for the river channels, you could have walked across the bay.  A storm surge height of 5 feet was recorded in Dauphin Island Bay.  A storm surge of 2.4 feet was recorded along the south shores of Dauphin Island and also near Bayou La Batre with the highest surge being 6.5 feet in Baldwin county along HWY 182, halfway between Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores.  Six feet of salt water was inside the historical 163 year old Fort Morgan.  Three turn of the century homes, on Fort Morgan, only sustained roof damage.  
Although Danny was downgraded to a depression Sunday morning at 1000 am, the slow northward movement caused extensive flooding across most of Choctaw county on Monday and Tuesday.  Rainfall totals of around 15 inches caused most streams in the county to come out of their banks.  The heavy rains also caused extensive flooding of roads, from Lisman to Butler south to near Gilbertown.
Except for some damage to the cotton crop in Escambia county Florida, Danny caused very little damage in Northwest Florida. 
One 41 year old male was killed as a result of the storm.  He was on his way to St. Thomas Island in a wooden sailboat with his dog.

High winds caused a  ferry, docked at Fort Gaines, to break away from its moorings on Saturday morning.  The runaway ferry destroyed the catwalk from the Dauphin Island weather observation platform.  The ferry wandered through the entrance of Mobile Bay coming to rest in a marsh near Gulf Shores.  
The state docks on the Mobile River recorded a low tide of -2 feet.  Most of the water was blown out by the storm Saturday morning for several hours. People observing the bay said they had never seen it so low.  Except for the river channels, you could have walked across the bay.  A storm surge height of 5 feet was recorded in Dauphin Island Bay.  A storm surge of 2.4 feet was recorded along the south shores of Dauphin Island and also near Bayou La Batre with the highest surge being 6.5 feet in Baldwin county along HWY 182, halfway between Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores.  Six feet of salt water was inside the historical 163 year old Fort Morgan.  Three turn of the century homes, on Fort Morgan, only sustained roof damage.  
Although Danny was downgraded to a depression Sunday morning at 1000 am, the slow northward movement caused extensive flooding across most of Choctaw county on Monday and Tuesday.  Rainfall totals of around 15 inches caused most streams in the county to come out of their banks.  The heavy rains also caused extensive flooding of roads, from Lisman to Butler south to near Gilbertown.
Except for some damage to the cotton crop in Escambia county Florida, Danny caused very little damage in Northwest Florida. 
One 41 year old male was killed as a result of the storm.  He was on his way to St. Thomas Island in a wooden sailboat with his dog.  He was trying to evacuate ahead of Danny when high winds blew him overboard.  He was found in the surf, near Gulf Shores.  His dog was found roaming the beach several days later and returned to relatives.  An elderly male fell victim to the storm, indirectly, suffering a heart attack as he was going to secure his boat in Baldwin county.",194

The center of the storm moved across Fort Morgan and into Mobile Bay during the early morning hours on Saturday. The storm remained nearly stationary over Mobile Bay for  eight hours.  Danny then creeped east, making landfall at Mullet Point, near Weeks Bay during the afternoon.  The storm continued moving slowly east across Baldwin county reaching Orange Beach during the evening.  Danny then drifted north along the Alabama and Florida border,  weakening to a depression near Walnut Hill Florida late Sunday morning.  Danny continued to drift north and passed through and out of Clarke county during the day Monday.  
Torrential rainfall fell generally along and south of I-10 in Mobile and Baldwin counties and throughout the central and south parts of Choctaw county.  The heaviest convection around Danny  shifted from the east to the west side of the storm while the center was over Mobile Bay. WSR-88D estimated an incredible 43 inches of  storm total rain over the open water in Mobile Bay.  Observing sites reported from 30 to 40 inches across the area with Dauphin Island reporting 36.71 inches with 25.98 inches of this falling between 5 PM and midnight on Saturday.  Unofficial estimates of 35 to 40 inches of rainfall were reported near the center of Danny as the storm moved across Weeks Bay.  As a result of the deluge, numerous roads were inundated and impassable for days. Record flooding caused major damage to homes along the Fowl River in Mobile county and the Fish river in Baldwin county.  A gauge site on the Fowl river at Laurendine Road recorded a height of 12.6 feet which is 1.5 times higher than the 100 year flood. At a gauge site on the Fish River near Silverhill a height of 22.8 feet was recorded, making this a 50 year flood event.  However, residents who have lived along the lower half of the Fish River for years, said this was the highest they had ever seen the river.  One reason for this,  was the heaviest rains fell south of the Silverhill gauging site.  More than 100 people had to be evacuated from their homes on Sunday as the Fish River overflowed its banks.  In Mobile county...Most of the roads on Dauphin Island were covered with more than a foot of water.  A CSX railroad trestle was undermined by flooding and collapsed at US HWY 90 and Ramsey Road.  In Baldwin county...numerous roads south of US HWY 98 and along roads near the Fish River were inundated and impassable for days.  
It was estimated that 80 percent of the Alabama public oyster reefs in Mobile county and 60 percent of the reefs in Baldwin county were destroyed and will take approximately 2 years to rebuild.  
Along the eastern shore, from Fairhope to Spanish Fort, heavy rains caused land slides and a few homes were teetering on the edge of Mobile Bay.  One home had to be relocated away from the edge of the Bay to prevent loss.  A 300 foot long sediment blockage, standing 6 feet high and 2 feet below the water, marooned up to 350 boats along the eastern shore marina slips.  For some of the marinas, the channels had to be redredged before boats could move in and out.   
On the east end of Dauphin Island, highest wind gusts were reported just over 100 mph with sustained winds of 70 to 80 mph. While inland at Mobile Regional Airport,  winds gusted to 45 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.  Wind gusts from Fort Morgan to Orange Beach were estimated at 80 to 100 mph.  Most homes and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings along the western shore of Mobile Bay and homes from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach sustained some type of roof damage.  Many homes in this area, with Gabled roofs, also suffered water damage as persistent winds blew rain into the attic through the vents in the ends of the homes.  A multi-story condominium under construction, near Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores, collapsed.  Numerous pecan and pine trees were blown over in the coastal areas of southwest Alabama with most extensive damage being in Baldwin county from Fairhope to Weeks Bay.  It was estimated that 70 percent of the Mobile pecan crop and 60 percent of the Baldwin crop for 1997 was lost.

This system became a tropical depression on August 8th about 240 miles north of Pohnpei. Winnie became a tropical storm on the 9th and a typhoon on the 10th. Winnie continued to rapidly intensify and became a Super Typhoon on the 12th. On the evening of the 12th Winnie passed between the Northern Marianas islands of
Pagan and Alamagan. The Northern Marianas island of Anatahan had most of it's banana crop destroyed and the island of Agrihan had four houses blown down and tin roofs blown away on others.

Winnie caused a major surge in the monsoon. This resulted in not only strong wind directly from the storm, but also far to the south of it. This caused power outages and crop damage across Guam, even when the storm center was 300 miles away. The peak wind at the National Weather Service Office on the 12th was 53 mph. The winds also caused a barge to break loose in Apra Harbor. The barge ran into an sank a 55 foot sail boat. On Saipan the high winds knocked out almost half of the islands power. The wind also blew the tin roofs off of seven houses and caused substansial damage to 3 others. 50 houses received minor damage. Winnie left the Guam Area of Responsibility on the 14th.

Tropical Storm Yule (15W) formed as a tropical disturbance on the 9th. It became a tropical onthe 17th. It passed 40 miles east of Wake Island onthe 20th. Highest winds on Wake Island were 40 mph with gust to 55 mph. Yule left the Guam Area of Responsibility on the 21st. No damge was reported

Tropical Storm BIng (19W) formed as a tropical on the monsson trough on August 26th about 250 miles northwest of Pohnpei. It became a tropical depression on the 27th and a tropical storm on the 29th when it 
was 130 miles east- southeast of Guam. The storm did cause some winds across the island of Guam, peak
wind at the Tiyan Weather Service Office was 28 mph on the 29th and 38 mph on the 30th. The more significant effect of Bing was that it brought copious amounts of rain to Guam on the 29th with 5.91 inches falling at the Tiyan Office.

With part of the circulation center on land, the storm weakened to Catagory I storm in the early morning hours of the 27th before making landfall near the Onslow/Pender county line. The storm then continued to move slowly northeast at speeds of 10 mph or less. Bonnie was downgraded to a Tropical Storm during the afternoon of the 27th but later was reclassified as a Hurricane as she moved off Kitty Hawk late in the evening. Bonnie was a unique storm in that the strongest winds were not located around the center of circulation like a typical hurricane but encompassed a large area in the eastern semi-circle. The most damaging winds were contained in the precursor rain bands where localized downbursts produced siginficant damage...especially along the coast of Carteret county which appeared to sustain the most damage from the storm. The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated. Coastal/Storm surge flooding  was not  as extensive as with Huuricanes Fran or Bertha but several locations did report significant problems. The hardest hit area was Belhaven where storm surge flooding along the Pungo River flooded 2/3rds of the homes in the area with water levels as high as 6 ft above normal. Other coastal flooding was reported in Manns Harbor and Stumpy Point in Dare county, Washington in Beaufort county, Near Hobucken in Pamlico county, Swansboro in Onslow county and along the south shore of the Albemarle sound in Washington and Tyrrell counties. Many docks, piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks.

The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated. Coastal/Storm surge flooding  was not  as extensive as with Huuricanes Fran or Bertha but several locations did report significant problems. The hardest hit area was Belhaven where storm surge flooding along the Pungo River flooded 2/3rds of the homes in the area with water levels as high as 6 ft above normal.

Many docks, piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks. Wind damage was greatest along Bogue Banks where two hotels and one department store lost roofs.

About 20 roads were blocked for several hours in Harnett county and there were numerous reports of trees being blown down across Sampson, Wayne, Johnston, Wilson, Harnett, and Cumberland counties. About ten thousand people lost power in these areas sometime during the storm. Tobacco losses were extensive. The estimated total value of the tobacco crop lost due to Bonnie ranged from 25 to 50 million dollars.

Rainfall amounts averaged 2 to 4 inches over the eastern Piedmont and Sandhills with amounts dropping rapidly west of Raleigh and Fayetteville.  For example, downtown Raleigh recorded around 2 inches of rain while the Raleigh/Durham Airport, 10 miles west of downtown, recorded only 1/3 of an inch.

Storm total rainfall amounts were generally under one half inch with a few isolated amounts around three inches.  Beach erosion was generally minor.  However, moderate to severe beach erosion was observed near Venice in Sarasota county.  Street flooding one to two feet deep was reported along the immediate coastal roads of Sarasota, Manatee and Pinellas counties.

Earl weakened to a tropical storm as it tracked northeastward through Central Georgia. Two-day rainfall totals ranged from 12.46 inches at Panama City, FL to 4.27 inches at Cross City, FL.  The peak 10-minute wind recorded at the Cape San Blas C-MAN buoy was 48 knots with a peak gust of 61 knots.  The lowest sea-level pressure recorded was 987 mb at the Panama City-Bay City International Airport.  The storm surge along the Florida Big Bend coast ranged from 6 to 12 feet above normal tide levels.  Significant beach erosion occurred along Coastal Walton County as well as Carrabelle Beach and Alligator Point.  Bay County experienced the worst urban and small stream flooding since Hurricane Opal in 1995.  Flooding occurred along the St. Marks River at Newport, FL where a crest of eight feet was measured.  Two fishermen died when their boat capsized in 16 to 20 foot seas offshore of Panama City Beach, FL.  Two persons were injured, one each in Walton and Jackson Counties.  Bay, Gulf, Franklin, Wakulla, Taylor, and Dixie counties were declared federal disaster areas.  

In Bay County, fresh water flooding damaged 1,049 homes, three businesses, and 50 other structures.  Three homes were destroyed. The Gulf Highlands subdivision in Panama City Beach suffered the worst flooding with up to five feet of water inside homes.  The Edgewater Beach Resort and Glades subdivision also sustained severe flooding.  Power outages affected 7,100 residents.  Other Bay County municipalities reported minor flood damage and numerous trees down.  Several roads, including FL 77, were temporarily closed until flood waters receded.  Holmes and Jackson counties reported several county roads washed out, numerous downed trees and  power lines, and minor damage to three homes.  A few county roads were closed to flooding and downed trees in Walton and Washington counties.  Erosion caused by heavy flooding damaged two roads in Liberty County.  Localized flooding with some downed trees and power lines occurred in Leon and Gadsden counties.  Throughout Madison, Lafayette, and Jefferson counties, there was minor damage from downed trees and power lines as well as some secondary roads closed to flooding.  Strong winds and flooding damaged one home, a state park, and closed 10 county roads in Calhoun County.  Across Gulf County, strong winds and flooding damaged 300 homes and disrupted power for 8,700 customers.  At Port St. Joe, storm surge flooding damaged 14 businesses and caused a water main break at the Lighthouse Utilities facility.  In Franklin County, storm surge flooding affected 136 homes and 15 businesses.  FL 65, 98, 300, and the St. George Causeway were closed to high water.  Alligator Point Road washed out stranding 50 people at Alligator Point.  Throughout Wakulla County, high winds and coastal flooding damaged 216 homes and businesses.  Significant wind and flood damage was reported at Live Oak Island, Spring Creek, Ochlocknee, Oyster Bay, Panacea, Medart, Sopchoppy, and St. Marks.  Power was disrupted for 1,000 customers and the St. Marks Wastewater facility.  Taylor County officials reported severe coastal flooding at Dekle and Keaton Beach with moderate flood damage to nine other coastal communities.  A total of 55 single-family units, six residences, and five businesses were affected.  CR 361 closed and water four feet deep over roads near the Econfina River.

Damage from "Earl" was considered minor.  However, cumulative damage estimates, primarily tornadic, from fifteen counties of West Central and Southwest Florida, yielded a value of 1.13 million dollars.

Storm total rainfall amounts were generally under one half inch with a few isolated amounts around three inches.  Beach erosion was generally minor.  However, moderate to severe beach erosion was observed near Venice in Sarasota county.  Street flooding one to two feet deep was reported along the immediate coastal roads of Sarasota, Manatee and Pinellas counties.

Wind damage was minor.  However, Hurricane Earl did spawn six tornadoes, one of which produced F2 damage and two minor injuries.

Although the eye of Hurricane Earl moved onshore near Panama City in the panhandle of Northwest Florida, storm tide was experienced along the entire west coast of Florida.

Hurricane Georges affected the region September 25 through the 29.  The coastal areas from Dauphin Island to east of Destin were put under a hurricane watch at 900 AM CST, September 25.  A hurricane warning was issued for the area at 900 AM CST, September 26.  The hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning for the area at 300 PM CST, September 28.  All tropical storm warnings for the area were dropped at 900 AM CST, September 29.
Georges made landfall along the Mississippi coast near Biloxi between 300 and 500 AM CST, September 28.
Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama and Northwest Florida were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 55 knots.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.
Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed.
Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.",342

Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.
Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed.
Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.",343

Hurricane Georges affected the region September 25 through the 29.  The coastal areas from Dauphin Island to east of Destin were put under a hurricane watch at 900 AM CST, September 25.  A hurricane warning was issued for the area at 900 AM CST, September 26.  The hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning for the area at 300 PM CST, September 28.  All tropical storm warnings for the area were dropped at 900 AM CST, September 29.
Georges made landfall along the Mississippi coast near Biloxi between 300 and 500 AM CST, September 28.
Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama and Northwest Florida were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 55 knots.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.

Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.
Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed.
Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.",357

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines. A maximum wind gust of 55 mph was recorded at New Orleans International Airport at 0411CST on September 28 before power was lost to the wind instrument. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees along Lake Pontchartrain, causing flooding of undeveloped areas. Approximately 3900 people sought refuge in public shelters in the parish.

Orleans Parish: The main affect to Orleans Parish was storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees, and wind damage to trees and resultant downing of power lines. A storm surge of 4 to 5 feet occurred in far east Orleans Parish causing water flooding of roadways and some damage to fishing camps and houses in the Lake Catherine, Irish Bayou, and Venetian Isles areas. A maximum stage of 5.81 ft was recorded at the Rigolets. Along the southwest shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about 85 out of 110 fishing camps built on wooden pilings were destroyed by storm surge and wind driven waves. Some of the camps were more than 75 years old. In the vicinity of West End Park, several restaurants were heavily damaged by storm surge and wind driven waves. A tide gage at West End Marina recorded a stage of 5.8 ft while the gage on the Industrial Canal reached 7.3 ft.

Plaquemine Parish: The lower portion of Plaquemine Parish received the greatest impact from Hurricane George with hurricane force wind gusts experienced late on September 27. An automated NOAA weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River recorded a maximum wind gust of 82 mph at 1653CST on September 27.  A storm surge of  7 to 8 feet was experienced along the east bank areas of the parish. A USGS tide gage in Gardene Bay east of Point a la Hache recorded a stage of 8.9 ft before power failed. Considerable storm surge flooding was recorded outside of the hurricane protection levees. About 50 homes and businesses outside of the levee system in the vicinity of Venice were reported to have flooded. Some wind damage to roofs, signs, and mobile homes also occurred within the levee protection system of southern Plaquemine Parish.  Power outages were widespread throughout the parish from the afternoon of September 27 through September 28.  Approximately 15,000 people in the southern portion of the parish evacuated with approximately 2300 people housed in public shelters in the northern portion of the parish.

St. Bernard Parish: The greatest impact from Hurricane Georges was experienced outside of the hurricane protection levee system. A 5 to 7 ft storm surge affected the parish with extensive flooding of low lying structures and roadways. Tide gages at Bayou Bienvenu and Bayou Dupre reached stages of 7.4 ft and 6.4 ft, respectively. Approximately 65 single family houses and mobile homes were damaged by flooding and wind. Severe erosion was reported in the coastal marshes, and especially in the nearby barrier islands of the Chandeleur Islands.  Power outages were widespread throughout the parish on September 27 and 28. Approximately 1300 people sought refuge in public shelters in the upper portion of St Bernard Parish.

A 48 mph wind gust was also recorded at the Slidell Airport at 2229 CST on September 27 before power was lost to the instrument. A storm surge of about 3 feet occurred on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.  The tide gage at Mandeville recorded a maximum stage of 4.3 ft. Some low lying areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain were flooded by the storm surge with 20 homes in the Palm Lake area of Slidell flooded.  During the storm clean-up, a 71 year old man was severely injured when a falling tree struck him while he was clearing debris from his property.

Across other areas of southeast Louisiana, damage was relatively minor and mostly confined to downed tree limbs and scattered reports of power outage due to downed power lines.",366

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27, it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast just to the east of Biloxi, MS at 0400 CST on September 28. The hurricane moved only slowly north during the morning hours, at times becoming nearly stationary. The hurricane finally was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1500CST on September 28 when it was located north of Biloxi. The tropical storm then moved very slowly eastward into southern Alabama on September 29. 

The greatest affect from the hurricane occurred over Jackson County which experienced the intense eastern portion of the hurricanes eyewall and highest storm surge.

Due to the slow forward speed of the hurricane very heavy rainfall occurred over eastern Harrison County and Jackson County leading to record flooding on streams and rivers. The barrier islands in the Mississippi Sound were also heavily damaged by wind and storm surge. A new three quarter mile cut developed in the east portion of Ship Island.  Total insured property damage in Mississippi was estimated at near 310 million dollars by insurance industry sources. When unisured losses and public property damage considered, total damages in Mississippi will likely approach $620 million.

Hancock County - Wind damage in Hancock County was mostly confined to large tree limbs snapped off, trees downed, and minor roof damage to houses and businesses, and damage to commercial signs. Storm surge was of minimal impact with the county remaining on the west side of the hurricane. Storm surge was 4 to 5 ft above normal with only minor coastal flooding and beach erosion occurring. Approximately 2,000 people were housed in public shelters.

Harrison County - Moderate wind damage occurred throughout the parish. Many commercial signs were damaged or destroyed, large trees limbs and trees downed, and wind damaged roofs or houses and businesses. At the Gulfport Harbor, a wind gage recorded a maximum gust of 80 mph at 0415CST on September 28.  At approximately the same time period, a gust to 117 mph was recorded in Gulfport, one mile north of the beach.  Storm surge flooding was generally 6 to 7 feet above normal across the coast. Storm surge flooding crossed US Highway 90 in several locations, but storm surge flooding to property was not considered major. A maximum stage of  8.1 ft was recorded at the Gulfport Harbor.

Due to the slow movement of the hurricane, heavy rain occurred over the east portion of the county and adjacent areas. Significant river flooding occurred on the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers on the September 28 and September 29.  Wortham, on the Biloxi River reached its second highest stage of record with a reading of 25.47 ft on September 29.  

Many county residents evacuated low lying areas in advance of the hurricane with approximately 3700 seeking refuge in public evacuation shelters within the county. 

Jackson County - Jackson County bore the brunt of Hurricane Georges with the area experiencing the strong right front quadrant of the hurricane's circulation. A storm surge of 8 to 11 feet caused storm surge flooding along low lying coastal areas. This was the greatest storm surge flooding in Jackson County in nearly 30 years. In the east beach section of the Bellefontaine area, 23 of 27 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Many businesses and industries located in low lying coastal areas were flooded causing considerable property damage and loss of revenue. The U.S. Navy facility at Pascagoula suffered $2.2 million in property damage, primarily roof and water damage. 

Several unofficial anemometers recorded gusts between 85 and 100 mph in the Pascagoula area. Moderate wind damage was reported across the parish. Numerous commercial signs were destroyed, trees downed, roofs damaged, and power lines and poles downed. 

Approximately 4600 people sought refuge in public hurricane evacuation shelters in Jackson County. Two shelters, one in Gautier and one in Pascagoula, suffered wind damage to the roof at the height of the storm. 

Due to the slow forward speed of Hurricane Georges, widespread heavy rainfall occurred over Jackson County and over the watershed of the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers. Rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was common over Jackson County. River flooding developed over much of the county by September 28. A record flood crest of 20.82 feet was established on Red Creek at Vestry. On the Escatawpa River, a record flood crest of 22.70 feet was established at Agricola.  Approximately 3,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas, primarily in the Escatawpa River basin, with hundreds of structures flooded in the county.  

Pearl River County - Damage was mainly confined to downed tree limbs and trees, minor to moderate roof damage to homes and businesses, and power outages from downed power lines. Several secondary highways and roadways in the county were blocked by fallen trees. Storm total rainfall was fairly light with amounts of 2 to 4 inches common.

A storm surge of 8 to 11 feet caused storm surge flooding along low lying coastal areas. This was the greatest storm surge flooding in Jackson County in nearly 30 years. In the east beach section of the Bellefontaine area, 23 of 27 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Many businesses and industries located in low lying coastal areas were flooded causing considerable property damage and loss of revenue. The U.S. Navy facility at Pascagoula suffered $2.2 million in property damage, primarily roof and water damage. 

Several unofficial anemometers recorded gusts between 85 and 100 mph in the Pascagoula area. Moderate wind damage was reported across the parish. Numerous commercial signs were destroyed, trees downed, roofs damaged, and power lines and poles downed. 

Approximately 4600 people sought refuge in public hurricane evacuation shelters in Jackson County. Two shelters, one in Gautier and one in Pascagoula, suffered wind damage to the roof at the height of the storm. 

Due to the slow forward speed of Hurricane Georges, widespread heavy rainfall occurred over Jackson County and over the watershed of the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers. Rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was common over Jackson County. River flooding developed over much of the county by September 28. A record flood crest of 20.82 feet was established on Red Creek at Vestry. On the Escatawpa River, a record flood crest of 22.70 feet was established at Agricola.  Approximately 3,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas, primarily in the Escatawpa River basin, with hundreds of structures flooded in the county.  

Pearl River County - Damage was mainly confined to downed tree limbs and trees, minor to moderate roof damage to homes and businesses, and power outages from downed power lines. Several secondary highways and roadways in the county were blocked by fallen trees. Storm total rainfall was fairly light with amounts of 2 to 4 inches common. About 200 people were sheltered in public hurricane evacuations shelters in the county.",368

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27, it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast just to the east of Biloxi, MS at 0400 CST on September 28. The hurricane moved only slowly north during the morning hours, at times becoming nearly stationary. The hurricane finally was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1500CST on September 28 when it was located north of Biloxi. The tropical storm then moved very slowly eastward into southern Alabama on September 29. 

The greatest affect from the hurricane occurred over Jackson County which experienced the intense eastern portion of the hurricanes eyewall and highest storm surge.

Due to the slow forward speed of the hurricane very heavy rainfall occurred over eastern Harrison County and Jackson County leading to record flooding on streams and rivers. The barrier islands in the Mississippi Sound were also heavily damaged by wind and storm surge. A new three quarter mile cut developed in the east portion of Ship Island.  Total insured property damage in Mississippi was estimated at near 310 million dollars by insurance industry sources. When unisured losses and public property damage considered, total damages in Mississippi will likely approach $620 million.

Hancock County - Wind damage in Hancock County was mostly confined to large tree limbs snapped off, trees downed, and minor roof damage to houses and businesses, and damage to commercial signs. Storm surge was of minimal impact with the county remaining on the west side of the hurricane. Storm surge was 4 to 5 ft above normal with only minor coastal flooding and beach erosion occurring. Approximately 2,000 people were housed in public shelters.

Harrison County - Moderate wind damage occurred throughout the parish. Many commercial signs were damaged or destroyed, large trees limbs and trees downed, and wind damaged roofs or houses and businesses. At the Gulfport Harbor, a wind gage recorded a maximum gust of 80 mph at 0415CST on September 28.  At approximately the same time period, a gust to 117 mph was recorded in Gulfport, one mile north of the beach.  Storm surge flooding was generally 6 to 7 feet above normal across the coast. Storm surge flooding crossed US Highway 90 in several locations, but storm surge flooding to property was not considered major. A maximum stage of  8.1 ft was recorded at the Gulfport Harbor.

Due to the slow movement of the hurricane, heavy rain occurred over the east portion of the county and adjacent areas. Significant river flooding occurred on the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers on the September 28 and September 29.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines. A maximum wind gust of 55 mph was recorded at New Orleans International Airport at 0411CST on September 28 before power was lost to the wind instrument. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees along Lake Pontchartrain, causing flooding of undeveloped areas. Approximately 3900 people sought refuge in public shelters in the parish.

Orleans Parish: The main affect to Orleans Parish was storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees, and wind damage to trees and resultant downing of power lines. A storm surge of 4 to 5 feet occurred in far east Orleans Parish causing water flooding of roadways and some damage to fishing camps and houses in the Lake Catherine, Irish Bayou, and Venetian Isles areas. A maximum stage of 5.81 ft was recorded at the Rigolets. Along the southwest shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about 85 out of 110 fishing camps built on wooden pilings were destroyed by storm surge and wind driven waves. Some of the camps were more than 75 years old. In the vicinity of West End Park, several restaurants were heavily damaged by storm surge and wind driven waves. A tide gage at West End Marina recorded a stage of 5.8 ft while the gage on the Industrial Canal reached 7.3 ft.

28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.

By 5 am the hurricane was about 100 miles south southwest of Cape Lookout.  By 1 pm the hurricane quickly moved to 75 miles south of Cape Hatteras and was downgraded to a Category I Hurricane.  By 11 pm Tuesday, August 31st the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm with a position of about 105 miles west of Cape Hatteras.  Tropical Storm Dennis was drifting at 4 mph and would remain in this quasi-stationary position for the next few days...only to return to eastern North Carolina and make landfall on September 4th along the Core Banks just north of Cape Lookout.

For most counties Hurricane Dennis left relatively little in its wake although on the Outer Banks beach erosion and the storm tide effects were extreme.  Unfortunately the hurricane approached eastern North Carolina during one of the highest astronomical tides of the month.  The dune structure on Hatteras Island was breeched in numerous locations.  Just north of Buxton...a 3000 foot long section of Highway 12 was completely lost.  Ocean storm surges were 3 to 4 feet above normal.  Along the Neuse River...tides were 8 to 10 feet above normal.  Numerous homes were flooded in the Harlowe...Adams Creek...and Club Foot Creek area.  Many reported this was the highest water levels they had ever seen.  In the New Bern area near the Trent River...6 feet of water was reported.  Oriental in Pamlico County reported tides 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Residents of Cedar Island in Carteret County...Ocracoke in Hyde County...and others in Pamlico County reported this was the highest water since 1933.  The most damaging winds were  found along the Outer Banks.  The Cape Lookout C-Man station reported sustained winds of 70 mph with gusts to 91 mph.  The greatest rainfall occurred over Carteret...southern Craven...Outer Banks Hyde...and Outer Banks Dare County.  Doppler radar estimates were near 6 to 8 inches with isolated areas of 8 to 10.  A Cooperative observer in Morehead City reported 7.83 inches.  No tornadoes were reported and only minor fresh water flooding was reported.  No fatalities were reported in direct relationship to Hurricane Dennis.

He also caused massive record flooding across inland sections of eastern North Carolina.  At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.  As with most hurricanes, inland flooded is now responsible for the largest percentage of  fatalities.",497

At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.
