High dewpoint temperatures melted most of the snow on the ground within 12 hours.  The snow pack had a liquid equivalent between 2 to 3 inches.  Snowmelt, combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain (some locations received nearly 5 inches), caused the worst regional flooding in over 10 years.  River flooding began during the flood/flash flood event along the headwaters of all basins and continued downstream through the 22nd.  Crests ranged from 3 to 21 feet above flood stage.

High water caused millions of dollars in damage, closed roads, destroyed homes and businesses, and forced the evacuation of several towns.  Four people were rescued by the National Park Service and Fairfax County Fire Department at Great Falls (VAZ053) when they wandered onto the rocks to view the raging Potomac and became stranded.  Several kayakers were also rescued while trying the sail the rough waters.  Although low-water bridges remained closed, a vehicle carrying three teenagers and one adult dared the high waters of the Hazel River (VAZ051) -- and lost.  All four perished as the automobile was swept downstream.

Flood waters covered Union Street and the lower part of King Street along the river in Old Town Alexandria (VAZ053), and affected Washington National Airport, but not the runways.  The city of Waynesboro (VAZ025) estimated $3 million in damage ($1 million to residential areas; $2 million to businesses).  In Rockingham Co (VAZ025), $2.2 million in damage was attributed to the loss of inventory at Hartz Corporation, an apparel manufacturer.  High water also caused $70 thousand in damage to Opequon Water Reclamation Facility in Frederick Co (VAZ028).

High dew point temperatures melted most of the snow on the ground within 12 hours, with liquid water equivalent ranging from 1 to 3 inches.  Snowmelt combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain (some locations received 5 inches) to produce, in some cases, catastrophic river flooding.  The flooding was the worst in the region since 1985.  River flooding began during the flood/flash flood event along the headwaters of the basins and continued downstream through the 22nd.  Crests ranged from 3 to 21 feet above flood stage.  Record flooding occurred on Wills Creek near Cumberland (MDZ002), damaging all dwellings in the town of Locust Grove.  Almost all dwellings in the town of Point of Rocks (MDZ004) were damaged by the flood waters in some way.

Unfortunately, the National Park Service's C&O Canal and towpath was also severely damaged.  Improvements made since the 1972 flooding (Tropical Storm Agnes) and 1985 were virtually destroyed once again.  Damage was estimated at $20 million for the park that runs along the Potomac from western Maryland the Washington, DC.  Largest losses were sustained just outside of Cumberland and along the southernmost stretch from Great Falls into Northwest Washington (MDZ009).  Flood waters covered 80 percent of the 184.5 mile canal.  Helicopter rescues continued for 24 hours across much of the state during the onset through peak flooding.  Antietam Battlefield National Park (MDZ003) estimated $11 thousand damage along Antietam Creek.

There were several water and sewage plant failures.  Water line breaks occurred in Lavale (MDZ002), and failures at Sharpsburg and Hagerstown (MDZ003) forced residents to boil water for 3 to 5 days (thousands of others were without water for 1 to 2 days).  The plants in Brunswick (MDZ004) and Havre De Grace (MDZ007) were shut down for 1 to 3 days due to flood waters and high turbidity.

There was structural damage to several bridges which cross the Potomac.  Three counties in central Maryland were declared under a federal state of emergency:  Washington, Allegany, and Frederick.

Snow melt in combination with the heavy rain resulted in flash flooding and then river flooding on most rivers. Record flooding occurred on portions of the Greenbrier River. 

Heavy rainfall and significant snow melt resulted in flash flooding which heavily damaged the public facilities at the Blue Bend Recreation Area near White Sulphur Springs, damaged several mobile homes near Rupert, washed out route 92 in three locations in Greenbrier County and flooded and damaged roads and a few bridges in Mercer County. Damage was estimated at $280,000 in Monroe County and $400,000 in Mercer County.

Thunderstorm winds downed several trees in Renick, Alderson, and Union.

High winds not associated with a thunderstorm downed trees which knocked out the power in Ballard. High winds ripped the roof off a motel in Princeton damaging a nearby house and truck.

Heavy rain and snow melt resulted in major to record flooding on portions of the Greenbrier River. The Greenbrier River crested 6.5 feet above flood stage at Renick at 1800 EST on the 19th. The Greenbrier River at Alderson crested at a record 24.53 feet at 0500 EST on the 20th. This crest was 10.53 feet above flood stage and .58 feet above the previous record flood of 11/05/85. The City Hall at Ronceverte was flooded by nearly 7 feet of water from the Greenbrier River. The building sustained substantial damage. A temporary City Hall was established in the old junior high gymnasium building. Flash flooding and flooding damaged 40 businesses and 152 houses in Ronceverte, 30 businesses and 250 houses in Alderson, and 4 businesses, 65 houses and a church in Caldwell. Around 150 people were evacuated and sought shelter in Greenbrier County.

Snowmelt combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain (some locations received 5 inches) to produce, in some cases, catastrophic river flooding.  The flooding was the worst in the region since 1985.  River flooding began during the flood/flash flood event along the headwaters of the basins and continued downstream through the 22nd.  Crests ranged from 3 to 21 feet above flood stage.  Record flooding occurred on Wills Creek near Cumberland (MDZ002), damaging all dwellings in the town of Locust Grove.  Almost all dwellings in the town of Point of Rocks (MDZ004) were damaged by the flood waters in some way.

Unfortunately, the National Park Service's C&O Canal and towpath was also severely damaged.

High dewpoint temperatures melted most of the snow on the ground within 12 hours.  The snow pack had a liquid equivalent between 2 to 3 inches.  Snowmelt, combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain (some locations received nearly 5 inches), caused the worst regional flooding in over 10 years.  River flooding began during the flood/flash flood event along the headwaters of all basins and continued downstream through the 22nd.  Crests ranged from 3 to 21 feet above flood stage.

High water caused millions of dollars in damage, closed roads, destroyed homes and businesses, and forced the evacuation of several towns.  Four people were rescued by the National Park Service and Fairfax County Fire Department at Great Falls (VAZ053) when they wandered onto the rocks to view the raging Potomac and became stranded.

High dew point temperatures melted most of the snow on the ground within 12 hours, with liquid water equivalent ranging from 1 to 3 inches.  Snowmelt combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain (some locations received 5 inches) to produce, in some cases, catastrophic river flooding.  The flooding was the worst in the region since 1985.  River flooding began during the flood/flash flood event along the headwaters of the basins and continued downstream through the 22nd.  Crests ranged from 3 to 21 feet above flood stage.  Record flooding occurred on Wills Creek near Cumberland (MDZ002), damaging all dwellings in the town of Locust Grove.  Almost all dwellings in the town of Point of Rocks (MDZ004) were damaged by the flood waters in some way.

Unfortunately, the National Park Service's C&O Canal and towpath was also severely damaged.  Improvements made since the 1972 flooding (Tropical Storm Agnes) and 1985 were virtually destroyed once again.  Damage was estimated at $20 million for the park that runs along the Potomac from western Maryland the Washington, DC.  Largest losses were sustained just outside of Cumberland and along the southernmost stretch from Great Falls into Northwest Washington (MDZ009).  Flood waters covered 80 percent of the 184.5 mile canal.  Helicopter rescues continued for 24 hours across much of the state during the onset through peak flooding.  Antietam Battlefield National Park (MDZ003) estimated $11 thousand damage along Antietam Creek.

There were several water and sewage plant failures.  Water line breaks occurred in Lavale (MDZ002), and failures at Sharpsburg and Hagerstown (MDZ003) forced residents to boil water for 3 to 5 days (thousands of others were without water for 1 to 2 days).  The plants in Brunswick (MDZ004) and Havre De Grace (MDZ007) were shut down for 1 to 3 days due to flood waters and high turbidity.

High dew point temperatures melted the entire snow pack within 12 hours, with liquid equivalents averaging 1 to 2 inches.  Snowmelt combined with 1 to 3 inches of rain caused the worst regional flooding in over 10 years.  No tidal variations were noted once the stage surpassed 10 feet.  The river crested at 13.88 feet (Wisconsin Avenue in lower Georgetown) on the 21st, dropping below flood stage (7 feet) by the 23rd.

River flooding in the city was limited to Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, and the Haines Point/Washington Marina area.  High water forced the closure of some waterfront property for several days, damaged homes and businesses, and brought heavy debris to the city's edge.  Portions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, as well as ramps to the Memorial Bridge and Clara Barton Parkway, were closed on the 22nd, causing the morning commute from the western suburbs to back up for miles.  Portions of Independence Avenue and Water Street SW, Wisconsin Avenue and K Street NW (Georgetown), and the Jefferson Memorial were closed.

had melted during the prior 5 days.  Only patches of snow remained

the mountainous counties.  The water content of that remaining
snow was 2 to 3 inches.  On Thursday the 18th, temperatures ahead
of a cold front rose into the 50s and 60s.  Dew points climbed
into the 50s.  Meanwhile, the winds increased.  Thus, the remaining mountain snow was melting rapidly as rain approached.  Six hour rainfall of 1.25 to 1.75 inches was common late Thursday night,
the 18th, into the predawn hours of Friday, the 19th.  Heavier rain fell in northern Pocahontas County and the highlands of Randolph County.  Rain amounts of 2 to 2.8 inches were measured around Snowshoe, Glady, Seneca State Forest, and Bartow.  A spotter at Minnehaha Springs measured 2.8 inches of rain.  Maximum estimated runoff of 4 to 6 inches occurred over the upper reaches of the Greenbrier River and the headwaters of the Shavers Fork.

Minor small stream flooding was common across Lincoln, Kanawha,
Harrison, Lewis, Doddridge, Taylor, Braxton, Fayette, Raleigh,
and Tyler Counties.  Moderate to major small stream flooding
occurred across Pocahontas, Randolph, Webster, Nicholas, Barbour,
and Upshur counties.  Leatherbark Creek and its small feeder
runs did extensive erosion damage to the track bed of the
Cass Railroad.  Damage along Knapps Creek in eastern Marlinton
was more severe than during the flood of November, 1985.

Headwater rivers rose quickly.  The worst damage was along
the Greenbrier River.  The forecast point at Buckeye crested
at 21 feet around 1400 EST on the 19th.  This was around 2
feet lower than during the November 1985 flood.  Many elderly
people were trapped on their second floor in Marlinton.  Water

The local grocery store had $60,000 of inventory destroyed.
East Cass had 2 to 3 feet of water, damaging 15 homes.  Over

County alone.  

Other headwater rivers to reach flood stage include the
Tygart Valley at both Belington and Philippi, the Little
Kanawha at Glenville, the Gauley at Camden, and the Elk
at Queens Shoals.  Yet, damage was less severe.

On the headwaters of the Elk River, small communities such
as Bergoo, Curtin, and Cherry Falls were flooded, along with
the town of Webster Springs.  In the Richwood vicinity of
Nicholas County, the Cherry River flooded homes in the Johnstown
and Riverside Addition.  A 69 year old Richwood man, with
previous heart problems, died while working on a sump dump.
Along the Shavers Fork of the Cheat River, flood water damaged
mobile homes and campers, especially at Bowden of Randolph
County.

Later, the Ohio River crested above flood stage at most points
between Willow Island and Huntington.  The crest was 4 to 5
feet above flood stage around Parkersburg, but dampened to
1 or 2 feet above flood stage near Huntington.  The smaller
towns such as Friendly, Sistersville, and St Marys sustained
more flooding compared to down river at Huntington.  The Corps
of Engineers flood control projects held water back from the mainstem Ohio River, causing this reduction down river.

Minor small stream flooding was common across Lincoln, Kanawha,
Harrison, Lewis, Doddridge, Taylor, Braxton, Fayette, Raleigh,

Cass Railroad.  Damage along Knapps Creek in eastern Marlinton
was more severe than during the flood of November, 1985.

Headwater rivers rose quickly.  The worst damage was along
the Greenbrier River.  The forecast point at Buckeye crested

people were trapped on their second floor in Marlinton.  Water
was 4 to 7 feet deep in the downtown business area of Marlinton.
The local grocery store had $60,000 of inventory destroyed.
East Cass had 2 to 3 feet of water, damaging 15 homes.  Over
300 individuals applied for federal assistance in Pocahontas
County alone.  

Other headwater rivers to reach flood stage include the
Tygart Valley at both Belington and Philippi, the Little
Kanawha at Glenville, the Gauley at Camden, and the Elk
at Queens Shoals.  Yet, damage was less severe.

On the headwaters of the Elk River, small communities such
as Bergoo, Curtin, and Cherry Falls were flooded, along with
the town of Webster Springs.  In the Richwood vicinity of
Nicholas County, the Cherry River flooded homes in the Johnstown
and Riverside Addition.  A 69 year old Richwood man, with
previous heart problems, died while working on a sump dump.
Along the Shavers Fork of the Cheat River, flood water damaged
mobile homes and campers, especially at Bowden of Randolph
County.

Later, the Ohio River crested above flood stage at most points
between Willow Island and Huntington.  The crest was 4 to 5
feet above flood stage around Parkersburg, but dampened to
1 or 2 feet above flood stage near Huntington.  The smaller
towns such as Friendly, Sistersville, and St Marys sustained
more flooding compared to down river at Huntington.  The Corps
of Engineers flood control projects held water back from the mainstem Ohio River, causing this reduction down river.  The crest at Parkersburg was 40.7 feet, at Point Pleasant 47.6 feet, and 51.9 feet at Huntington.  All three cities installed some of their flood gates along the floodwall.

Fortunately the flooding was not as severe as the previous week.  But, a 72-year-old woman drowned on River Road in Upper Makefield Township (Bucks County) at 930 a.m. on the 28th.  She apparently drove around three roadblocks and became stuck in the deep flood waters of the Delaware River.  Her body was found near the Prickly Pear Restaurant.

Along the Lehigh River, precautionary evacuations occurred in Walnutport, Freemansburg and Easton and on Adams Island.  The flood waters tore away a 35 to 45 foot chunk of the Lehigh Canal Towpath in Allentown.  In Northampton County, the Bushkill Creek flooded parts of downtown Easton.  Pennsylvania State Route 611 was closed along the Delaware River because of flooding.  Flooding along the Delaware River also forced other road closures in Harmony Township.  In Berks County,  flooding along the Schuylkill River forced roadway closures in Tilden and Perry Townships.  In Chester County, stream flooding caused many road closures including Pennsylvania State Route 100.  In Montgomery County, two elderly Pottstown women were rescued from the flooded Industrial Highway.  Other water rescues occurred, mainly from people trying to drive on barricaded roads.  Two bridges were closed because of structural damage, the Mather Road Bridge over the Wissahickon Creek in Whitpain Township and the Cedar Hill Road Bridge over Park Creek in Horsham Township.  A park was badly damaged by flood waters in Pottstown.  In Bucks County, Delaware River flooding forced the closure of River Road/Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Tinicum and Bridgeton Townships and Yardley.  Several other road closures occurred in Yardley.
