Hurricane Bertha made landfall near Wilmington North Carolina close to 5 p.m. EDT on the 12th and moved northnortheast overnight.  At 11 p.m. EDT it was 100 miles southwest of Norfolk, at 3 a.m. EDT on the 13th it was 45 miles westsouthwest of Norfolk, at 8 a.m. EDT it was 45 miles south of Dover, at 930 a.m. EDT it was in extreme northeastern Sussex County and at 11 a.m. EDT it was near Atlantic City.

While the long trip over land did weakened Bertha, some wind related damage did occur in Sussex and Kent Counties.  The only tidal flooding was minor and occurred on Delaware State Route 54 near Fenwick Island, one of the most flood roads in the state.  Beach erosion was minor.  The tropical storm did drop between 1.5 and 3.0 inches of rain across most of the state, with locally higher amounts of around 4 inches reported by SKYWARN Spotters in Sussex County.  This caused some poor drainage flooding, but the only river to flood was the Christina in New Castle County.  Wind gusts reached 58 mph in Dover and 55 mph in Lewes.  The strongest winds occurred between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. EDT. Power was lost for up to 8 hours by 3,200 homes in the state; most were restored by noon EDT. 

Even two days before Bertha arrived rough surf resulted in 40 water rescues at Bethany Beach on the 11th.  Seashore state campgrounds were closed and shelters were set up, but less than 100 persons used them.  In Bethany Beach, a few poles were snapped and tree limbs came down.  A Subway sign was blown away in Seaside Village.  

Elsewhere, there was minor wind damage reported in Kent and Sussex Counties with storage sheds suffering the most harm.  Many were thrown around.  Some of the worst wind related damage occurred in northwestern parts of Kent County around Clayton and Blackiston.  In Clayton, downed trees blocked three roads.  The roof was blown off one house and the porch roof was blown off another.  Several poles were also knocked down.  Flying debris caused damage to several other garages, homes and porches.

On the 15th a peak wind of 47 mph was observed at Anderson Air Force Base on northern Guam and 29 mph  observed at the National Weather Service Office in Tiyan. On the 15th 5.26 inches of rain fell at Anderson Air Force Base and 3 inches at the Tiyan Weather Service Office as a spiral band from the tropical storm passed across the island. This caused Urban and Small Stream flooding in some areas. Tropical Storm Ivan became a typhoon during the late afternoon of the 15th, but was already moving away from the Marianas Islands. The typhoon remained in the Guam Area of Operations until the 17th.

Super Typhoon Joan (28W) formed on the 11th to the east of Majuro. It became a tropical storm onthe 14th and reached typhoon strength on the 15th. The typhoon continued to intensify as it moved west-norhwest. It passed about 50 miles north of Saipan and 30 miles south of Anatahan on the 18th. Saipan was slow to respond to the threat of the typhoon, as a result, people were still making storm preperations when the high winds began. Three people were injured when they were boarding up their house. The injuries were caused in part by flying boards. By hte morning of the 19th the entire inland of Saipan had lost power. A few houses had tin roofs damaged. At least 37 houses were destroyed. Anatahan did not fare as well. Damage was extensive across the island. Machinery, boats and public property sustained damage. Crops such as banana, cassava and taro were also damaged. All of the damage on Anatahan amounted to at least $200,000.

A band of moisture flowing into Typhoon Joan moved across Guam on the 19th. This resulted in 1.99 inches 
of rain falling at the Tiyan Weather Office and 2.20 inches at Anderson Air Force Base. This band also caused winds to gust to 41 mph at the Tiyan Weather Office.

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",171

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",172

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning.

September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.

Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",175

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",179

A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",182

Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",185

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",188

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning.

Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th.

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",191

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated.

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.

The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening.

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.

The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. 

Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.

The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. 

Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.

This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

Helene quickly weakened to a tropical depression Friday afternoon as it accelerated northeast into southeast Alabama.  Storm total rainfall ranged from a half inch at Perry and to 9.56 inches at Apalachicola, Florida.  The highest sustained wind of 30 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph was recorded at Cape San Blas.  The lowest sea-level pressure was 1011 mb at Panama City.  

Coastal storm tides of two feet or less above astronomical tide levels were common, with only minor beach erosion reported.  The torrential rainfall caused extensive flooding throughout Franklin, Wakulla and Leon counties.  The flooding prompted city and county officials to close schools, universities and public offices and kept emergency crews busy rescuing stranded motorists.  Utility crews worked diligently to restore power to homes, and clearing streets and county roads of storm debris.  Numerous homes along the Sopchoppy River in Wakulla County were flooded, with secondary and county roads washed out.  The river crested at 34.9 feet, breaking the record of 34 feet in 1970.  Numerous homes in northern Wakulla County were affected when sinkholes backed up with flood waters.  Flooding was also reported at Walker Crossing and at the Wildwood Golf Course near Medart.  Nearly 70 streets in Tallahassee were impassable due to high water.  Over 100 homes in Leon County were affected by flood waters.  50 residents were evacuated from the flooded Carriage Estates mobile home park and another 20 were rescued from the Sandpebble Apartments in Tallahassee.  Scattered power outages left 5,000 homes without electricity in Leon and Wakulla counties when water-logged tree limbs were blown into power lines.  Minor flooding was reported in Bay, Jefferson, Calhoun, Madison and Gulf counties.

Numerous tornadoes were reported. In Franklin County, brief touchdowns at Alligator Point, Eastpoint and in several rural wooded areas.  In Wakulla County, two touchdowns, of which one destroyed several mobile homes.  In Jefferson County, two touchdowns which damaged two mobile homes, a barn and vehicle.  The counties of Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gulf, Jefferson, Leon and Wakulla were declared federal disaster areas.","",370

Allison moved northward, making landfall on the west end of Galveston Island between midnight and 1am on the 6th, less than 12 hours after forming.  As Allison moved inland it caused two to three foot tides, which had little impact on the area.  On the evening of the 5th a tornado briefly touched down in Brazoria county causing damage to one home in the Manvel area.  Over the next five days Allison produced record rainfall that led to devastating flooding across Southeast Texas, killing 22 people and damaging over 48,000 homes, 70,000 automobiles and nearly 2000 businesses.

The first significant flooding occurred while Allison was still offshore.  A large spiral band with very heavy rainfall moved inland from Galveston to the Houston area, and by mid evening 8 to 12 inch totals were common from northern Galveston county into southern Harris county.  Heavy rain continued over inland portions of Southeast Texas overnight with 3 to 5 inch totals common, as Allison moved inland and weakened.

On the morning of June 6th, Allison was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Allison moved north until it was near Lufkin, then made a clockwise loop and began drifting to the southwest.  Before sunrise on June 7th, the center was near Huntsville, and a band of heavy rain moved into Liberty county producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, causing almost a foot of water on Highway 90.  Around the same time another area of thunderstorms developed over the Sugar Land - Stafford areas of Fort Bend and Harris counties, producing another 8 to 12 inches of rain and causing abundant street flooding and water in some homes.  During the day moderate to heavy rain continued over Brazoria, Houston, Liberty, Polk, Trinity and Walker counties resulting in additional reports of flooding.

June 8th began with another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall along the immediate coast, causing flooding in southern Brazoria county, central Galveston county and northern Chambers county.  Skies cleared for a few hours, but the rain began again that afternoon over Montgomery county.  Thunderstorms intensified rapidly over southern Montgomery and eastern Harris counties and began to train across the Houston metro area that evening and into June 9th.  Very heavy rainfall was observed for up to 10 hours in some locations, and rainfall rates of 4 inches or more per hour were observed throughout the night.  Flash flooding initiated quite rapidly during rush hour late Friday afternoon.  Widespread street flooding was the initial threat, but the high rainfall amounts forced almost all the major Houston area bayou systems into severe flooding, with some to record levels.  The flooding caused a complete shutdown of downtown Houston, including all major roadways and both major airports for more than 12 hours.  The Texas Medical Center along Brays Bayou sustained severe damage resulting in the complete shutdown of several hospitals and a significant loss of research data.  Twenty-two people lost their lives due to the flash flooding in Harris county on the 8th and 9th.

On June 9th the circulation center of the storm gradually made its way toward Palacios.

After meandering over southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana for several days and causing major flooding and loss of life in Texas and Louisiana, the Tropical Depression then moved along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama and into South Georgia on the 11'th.  By now, downgraded to just a low pressure area, the remnants then took a turn more to the northeast passing near Macon on the 12'th and near Augusta on the 13'th.  While wind was not a problem with this storm, very heavy rain had been a problem from the beginning.  Spiral bands of heavy rain and some thunderstorms began affecting east central and middle Georgia during the afternoon of the 11'th, with additional development of heavy rain on the 12'th and 13'th, especially in eastern areas. The heaviest rain fell from the evening of the 12'th through the early morning hours of the 13'th in an area generally bounded by Athens, Eatonton, Milledgeville, Crawfordville, and Lexington. In these areas, 24 rainfall amounts of 5 to 8 inches were common, with 10 inches observed in 24 hours on the Little River five miles southeast of Washington in Wilkes county.  Two to three day rainfall totals exceeded 10 inches in several places in this area.  The Little River crested at 28.4 feet, exceeding the previous highest stage ever recorded of 26.4 feet.  Flooding was also observed on the Oconee River at Milledgeville with a crest of 33.7, two feet above flood stage.  Several counties were significantly impacted by the flooding rainfall with many roads and bridges being washed out.

The circulation moved westward over the next few days and gradually strengthened to become Tropical Depression 06W at 1900 local on the 1st. At this time the tropical depression was located near 7N 138E or 195 miles east of Palau. The system continued to intensify and became Tropical Storm Utor on the afternoon of
the 2nd. At this time Utor was 100 miles northwest of Yap. The tropical storm continued to move to the northwest and away from Yap and Palau. Utor was 184 miles northwest of Yap by the evening of the 2nd.  The track of the tropical cyclone took it between Yap and Palau. Heavy rain and gusty winds were experienced at both locations as cyclone passed by. 

Max sustained winds at the weather service office in Koror Palau were 35 mph with gust to 65 mph on July 2nd.  The greatest rainfall recorded during the storm passage was at the Weather Service Office on Palau with 10.18 inches falling during a 24-hour period from the 1st to the 2nd.  Total rainfall recorded for the entire storm passage was 13.24 inches from the morning of the 1st to the evening of the 2nd. 

Gusty winds and heavy rains from Utor caused disruption across Palau. The heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides, which damaged 15 roads in Koror, Palau. The mudslides also affected water pipes, sewage pipes and underground telephone lines. Several electrical transmission lines were damaged from fallen trees resulting in an island-wide blackout. 

The gusty winds also knocked down numerous tresses across Palau. In Ngeremlengui State, a key bridge in the Ngermeskang Bridge, locally known as Koba Bridge, was washed away during the storm, cutting off traffic from northwest Babeldaob toward the south, including Koror. On the West Coast, a section of the public road Between Nekken and the Koksai junction were damaged by the storm. 

47 residential homes were damaged across Palau. The estimated cost to fix these homes amounted to $417,000. Many of the houses were of wood and tin roof construction.  A few of the houses had their roofs blown off. In addition to the roof damage, some houses received water damage after the heavy rain poured through the damaged roof.  

A landslide occurred in the vicinity of the U.S Embassy. The landslide eroded 38 meters of paved road and one half of the road width near the embassy. In Olluu, Angaur a breadfruit tree fell on top of the Catholic Church and in Ngaramas, Angaur a Mountain Apple tree fell on the Old Age Center. 

The force of the waves damaged the docks at Ngardmau and Rois, Angaur.  Waves also caused damage to a seawall at Ngaremlengui beach in Ngermetengel. 

Landslides caused damage to fiber optic and copper communication cables that were buried at the side of some roadways. The fiber optic cable carries much of the islands communication and is linked to an earth station at Meyuns. With the fiber optic cable severed by the landslide, Palau lost much of its communication with the rest of the world. Limited access via the copper cable was possible. Cost
to fix the communication problem was about $26,000.    

Crops were also affected throughout Palau. Depending on location crops received varying amounts of damage. 
                     Cassava plants were between 30 to 85 % damaged. 
                     Bananas between 25 to 85% mainly young and mature fruit bearing trees  
                     Taro    between    10 to 90% some damaged from salt water intrusion and other from

                    Coconut and Pandanus 20% in one state, no reports from others.
                    One Tapioca farm was flooded, but unknown damage amount. 


Yap had 30 mph with gust to 50 mph. An automated weather station on Ulithi, an island to the northeast of Yap had gust to 55 mph on the 2nd. An automated weather station on Ngulu, an island to the south of Yap recorded a gust to 40 mph on the second.  The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 991.2 mb on Yap on the morning of the 2nd. 

On Yap exposed beaches on the south and southwest side of the island was eroded due to high surf. About 10 percent of the road along the beachfront was washed away on the southwest side of the island. These areas are susceptible to damage from high surf, especially from southerly winds because the reefs are close to the shoreline. Riverbanks and low-lying areas on Yap were flooded. A few banana trees and some weak tree branches were damaged. Some tin-roofed structures that were in open areas had were blown off. A few termite infested houses collapsed. 

No injuries or deaths were reported in Palau or Yap as a result of Tropical Storm Utor's passage  through the area.",397

After landfall, Barry rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over southwest Alabama.  Maximum sustained winds prior to landfall were measured at 39 knots with a peak gust to 54 knots at the Gulf data buoy 42039 (85 nautical miles south of Apalachicola, Florida) during the late afternoon of 5 August.  As the center of Barry moved onshore, a peak wind gust of 55 knots was recorded at the Eglin AFB Range Station C-52 (10 miles northwest of Freeport, Florida, in Walton County) about 130 am CDT on 6 August.  At the same location, the lowest sea-level pressure recorded was 994.2 mb at 1247 am CDT.  Scattered wind damage was reported throughout Walton, Washington, Bay, Calhoun and Gulf counties as trees and limbs fell into power lines.  Over 40,000 homes were without power.  In Bay County, several homes were inundated by water due to roof damage.

Due to its slow motion toward the Florida Panhandle coast, rainbands affected the coastal areas as early as the late afternoon of 4 August, with the heaviest rainfall observed on 5-6 August.  Official storm totals ranged from 2.37 inches at Marianna  to 8.91 inches at Tallahassee, Florida.  An unofficial total of 11 inches was reported by WJHG-TV in Panama City, Florida.

Maximum storm tides ranged from a foot in coastal Franklin County, to three feet in coastal Walton County where minor beach erosion was reported.  Minor to no beach erosion was observed from coastal Bay, Gulf and Franklin counties.  

Significant flooding occurred in Leon County, including the Tallahassee area, as well as the northwest Apalachicola National Forest, where excessive rains flowed southward into the Cascade Lakes, Lake Bradford and Munson Slough.  The Munson Slough rose to its highest level since the 1994 floods.  Dozens of homes were affected, as well as horses, livestock, vehicles and equipment.  Numerous county and secondary roads across Walton, Washington, and Bay counties were closed to floodwaters.","",416

By sunrise, high end tropical storm force wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were common from the mouth of Tampa Bay south to Charlotte Harbor.  Gabrielle continued to move northeast and made landfall, south of Venice, in Sarasota county, between 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. EST.  The lowest sea level pressure observed with landfalling Garbrielle was 983.1 millibars at the Venice C-MAN site at 7:00 a.m. EST.  At the Venice C-MAN site, a maximum wind gust of 73 mph from the northwest was observed at 9:00 a.m. EST as feeder bands on the storms northwest side began to move over southern Sarasota county.  Although storm total rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches from Gabrielle were common across Southwest and parts of West Central Florida, a maximum storm total rainfall amount of 11.65 inches was reported in Palmetto in Manatee county.

Maximum storm tides observed were around 6 feet near the mouth of the Peace River in Charlotte Harbor shortly after sunrise.  Total damage across the 15 county area of Southwest and West Central Florida from Gabrielle was estimated to be nearly 17 million dollars.
Gabrielle continued to move northeast across the Florida peninsula and was centered over central Polk county by mid afternoon of the 14th.  Winds across West central and Southwest Florida subsided to below tropical storm force by late afternoon.  However, wrap around western outer bands of Gabrielle continued to bring a second brush of low end tropical storm force wind gusts to Citrus, Sumter,  Hernando, Pasco and Hillsborough counties from 7 p.m. EST on September 14th, through 3 am EST on September 15th.

In Lee county, tropical storm wind gusts of 45 to 55 mph and flooding caused up to 5.7 million dollars in damage.  Most of the wind damage was caused to roof shingles, carports and lanais, mainly in the Cape Coral area.

On Thursday, September 5th, this disturbance became the sixth tropical depression of the 2002 hurricane season with a poorly defined center located approximately 125 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas.  That evening, just six hours after formation, the depression became Tropical Storm Fay as winds strengthened to 40 mph.

Fay remained nearly stationary Thursday night and through most of Friday.  However, Fay did manage to slowly strengthen with winds reaching 60 mph late Friday morning (September 6th).  On Friday evening, Fay began to redevelop further west near a cluster of strong thunderstorms.  These thunderstorms began pushing inland along the southeast Texas coastline between San Luis Pass and Palacios around 11 PM CDT.  As this cluster of thunderstorms moved inland, it produced extremely heavy rainfall, tornadoes, and strong damaging wind gusts. The center of Fay moved inland early Saturday morning (September 7th) near Palacios and weakened to a tropical depression late that morning.

There were no deaths in Southeast Texas associated with Fay.  Three people were injured when a tornado damaged a mobile home in southern Fort Bend County Friday night.  Fay produced a total of five tornadoes along a path from Freeport in Brazoria County to near Hungerford in Wharton County.  

Flooding was significant in Brazoria, Matagorda and Wharton counties due to high tides and severe rainwater flooding.  Between 10 and 20 inches of rain fell in an area from Freeport north-northwest to Boling in eastern Wharton County.  The hardest hit area was near the community of Sweeny in southwest Brazoria County.  In Brazoria County, over 1500 homes were flooded. Over 800 homes received damage from winds and tornadoes. Nearly 100 businesses and nearly 100 multi-family buildings were damaged.  Nearly 500 cars were flooded.  In Matagorda County, 130 single family homes and 32 businesses were damaged mainly by flood waters.  As a result of high tides and heavy rain, over $1.2 million in damage was done to public facilities including roads, bridges and public buildings.  In Wharton County, over 200 single family homes were damaged or destroyed. Tornadoes damaged 7 homes while the remainder of the damage was due to flooding.

It is estimated that beach erosion from high tides produced $3.5 million in damage to public roads, bridges and recreational areas across Galveston County. Another half a million dollars in damage from the high tides was inflicted on 135 residential structures.  Of these 135 structures, 23 received major damage. 

The highest reported wind gust was in the town of Clute in Brazoria County where an 83 mph wind gust was recorded at 120 AM CDT on Saturday.

The highest recorded tide level occurred at Jamaica Beach where the tide level reached 5.40 feet above mean low-lower water at 830 AM CDT Saturday morning, September 7th.","",492
