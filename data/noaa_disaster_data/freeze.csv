Freeze damage to crops over the region was estimated to be 12.9 million dollars.  Nearly 90 percent of Southwest Florida's winter crop was severely damaged by the freeze.

Primary crops severely damaged by the freeze were beans, squash, tomatoes, sweet corn, zucchini, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, cabbage, watermelons and strawberries.  Exotic fruit and plants were also damaged by the freeze, primarily over Southwest Florida.

Crop losses in Lee county were reported at $9.8 million dollars, Charlotte county reported $2.2 million dollars, Highlands county $583,000 dollars, and $294,000 dollars.  Freeze damage to other counties in
West Central and Southwest Florida was minimal.

Citrus damage was concentrated over Lee, Charlotte, De Soto, Hardee, Sarasota, Manatee, Highlands and Polk counties in descending order.  Lee county reported citrus fruit losses of nearly 50 percent while Charlotte county reported a 45 percent loss.  Citrus fruit damage in De Soto county was estimated at 35 percent, Sarasota and Manatee counties 30 percent, Hardee county 25 percent, while Highlands and Polk counties estimated nearly 20 percent.  Wood damage to citrus trees in De Soto county was reported as serious while Highlands county reported moderate to heavy damage.  Freeze damage to the wood of citrus trees, to a lessor extent, was also reported in Hardee, Sarasota, Manatee, Charlotte and Lee counties.

The freeze also caused a major power outage in the city of Arcadia in Hardee county where nearly 7,000
residents were without electricity for at least eight hours.","",84

Accelerated growth in the central Shenandoah Valley led to the highest kill percentage.  Estimates from agricultural extension agents of the Virginia Dept. of Emergency Services showed at least 70 to 90 percent "kill" of the peach crop, and similar kills among the Red Delicious apple crop.  Some of the statistics include:  Clarke Co (VAZ031), $1.36 million, involving over 2800 acres; Frederick Co (VAZ028), 7200 apple and 420 peach acres significantly damaged; Warren Co (VAZ030), over 500 acres affected.  Golden Delicious apples, a normally later blooming variety, escaped a major kill.  Berry fruits sustained partial (but still substantial) kills.
