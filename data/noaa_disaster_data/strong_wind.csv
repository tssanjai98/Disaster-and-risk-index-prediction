Temperatures rose into the 50s along and east of the track of the low center...over Plymouth County and Cape Cod.  Heavy precipitation occurred across all of Massachusetts with rain over coastal areas and the southeast part of the state and heavy snow in all of western and central Massachusetts and much of Middlesex and Essex counties in the northeastern part of the state.  A very distinct rain-snow line existed throughout this storm.  It was oriented from south-southwest to north-northeast and extended from extreme western Norfolk County across Middlesex County to Essex County.  Lightning and thunder was observed during the evening of December 7th along the rain-snow line.  

Some snowfall totals for this storm event and totals on the ground from a heavy snowstorm which occurred on December 6th included:  Ashburnham, 18 inches with 26 inches on the ground;  West Townsend, 17 inches with 25 inches on the ground;  Worcester, 14 inches; Ware, 13 inches with 15 inches on the ground; Westboro, 12.3 inches; Shrewsbury, 12.2 inches with 19 inches on the ground; Springfield, 8 inches; Greenfield, 6.1 inches with 9 inches on the ground; Tyngsboro, 6.0 inches; Billerica, 5 inches;  and Lowell, 4.8 inches.  

The snow was especially wet and heavy, resulting in heavy damage to trees and power lines.  Power lines and tree limbs began snapping under the weight of the snow shortly after 7 PM on Saturday evening, December 7th.  Widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands of people occurred in Worcester, Middlesex, and Essex Counties.  Statewide, about 500,000 people lost power at some point during the storm, but extended power outages (lasting several days) occurred in central Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley and affected about 113,000 electric customers.  Thousands of trees and limbs knocked down by the snow forced police to close sections of many roads.  At least a couple of people received minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Hundreds of homes and vehicles were damaged when snow-laden tree limbs crashed down.  Thousands of people endured several days with no power or heat and many left their homes for shelters set up by local governments and the American Red Cross.  

Strong to gale force east to southeast winds occurred over the southeast part of the state and especially along the coast from Cape Cod to the New Bedford area.    A peak wind gust to 64 mph from the east-southeast was recorded at West Island on Buzzards Bay.  In addition, heavy rain totalling 1.5 to just over 2 inches resulted in street flooding.   A number of roads were reported completely flooded in the New Bedford area, where over  2 inches of rain was reported.

Some snowfall totals for this storm event and totals on the ground from a heavy snowstorm which occurred on December 6th included:  Ashburnham, 18 inches with 26 inches on the ground;  West Townsend, 17 inches with 25 inches on the ground;  Worcester, 14 inches; Ware, 13 inches with 15 inches on the ground; Westboro, 12.3 inches; Shrewsbury, 12.2 inches with 19 inches on the ground; Springfield, 8 inches; Greenfield, 6.1 inches with 9 inches on the ground; Tyngsboro, 6.0 inches; Billerica, 5 inches;  and Lowell, 4.8 inches.  

The snow was especially wet and heavy, resulting in heavy damage to trees and power lines.  Power lines and tree limbs began snapping under the weight of the snow shortly after 7 PM on Saturday evening, December 7th.  Widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands of people occurred in Worcester, Middlesex, and Essex Counties.  Statewide, about 500,000 people lost power at some point during the storm, but extended power outages (lasting several days) occurred in central Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley and affected about 113,000 electric customers.  Thousands of trees and limbs knocked down by the snow forced police to close sections of many roads.  At least a couple of people received minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Hundreds of homes and vehicles were damaged when snow-laden tree limbs crashed down.  Thousands of people endured several days with no power or heat and many left their homes for shelters set up by local governments and the American Red Cross.  

Strong to gale force east to southeast winds occurred over the southeast part of the state and especially along the coast from Cape Cod to the New Bedford area.    A peak wind gust to 64 mph from the east-southeast was recorded at West Island on Buzzards Bay.  In addition, heavy rain totalling 1.5 to just over 2 inches resulted in street flooding.   A number of roads were reported completely flooded in the New Bedford area, where over  2 inches of rain was reported.  

The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency stated that dollar damages totalled $4,080,700 for public -type damage.  When private sector damage (trees onto homes, etc.) is taken into account, we have roughly estimated the total storm damage to be approximately $15 million.",91

The surface low pressure system went from a pressure of 1012 millibars in Western Kentucky the morning of the 5th to a pressure of 986 millibars just east of Boston the morning of the 6th.  The drop of 26 millibars or .78 inches of mercury within a 24 hour period constitutes what's called a meteorological bomb.  The rapid intensification of this storm helped cause the very strong winds.   The strong offshore winds also helped produce the relatively rare blow-out tide conditions at times of low tides from around noon on the 6th through around noon on the 7th.   The strongest wind gusts for most places coincided with this low pressure system's cold frontal passage during the early morning of the 6th.  But winds remained very strong until the sun set that afternoon.  

Delmarva Power and Light reported about 3,000 customers lost power across the peninsula with the most reports in Delaware in New Castle County.  The strongest wind gust at Dover AFB was 55 mph.

The low pressure system responsible for this looked rather innocuous on March 30th as it moved with its associated cold front through the Midwest.  Temperatures that day (Easter Sunday) warmed into the 70s across most of Delaware.  But as the low intensified off the New Jersey Coast on March 31st,  it pulled down colder air.  The heavy precipitation it created also cooled the atmosphere and changed the rain over to snow at times of heavier precipitation bursts in the northern half of the state from the afternoon of March 31st into the early morning of April 1st.  These bands of heavier snow moved through the Middle Atlantic States and caused wide variations in accumulations that were both location (underneath these bands) and elevation dependent.  One such band affected the northwest part of New Castle County where accumulations exceeded five inches. Less snow (3 to 4 inches on average) accumulated farther southeast including the city of Wilmington.   

Strong northwest winds on both March 31st and April 1st caused some blowing and drifting of the snow in northwest New Castle County.  In addition, the weight of the heavy, wet snow tore down tree limbs and produced scattered power outages.  Very little snow accumulated farther south in Delaware, but gusty northwest winds that circulated around the low pressure system buffeted the state for two days.  The peak wind gust at the New Castle County Airport was 43 mph, but stronger gusts occurred farther south.  A wind gust of 58 mph was recorded by the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.  The strong winds also pulled down power lines and caused scattered outages in Sussex County and isolated outages in Kent County.  The very strong winds also forced the Cape May/Lewes Ferry to reduce their number of trips across Delaware Bay.",247

Temperatures that day (Easter Sunday) warmed into the 50s and 60s across the area.  But as the low intensified off the New Jersey Coast on the 31st,  it pulled down colder air.  The heavy precipitation it created also cooled the atmosphere and changed the rain over to snow.    The rain changed to snow close to dawn across extreme Northwest New Jersey.  The changeover progressed southeast reaching the rest of Northwest New Jersey around 9 a.m. EST and the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area close to noon EST.  Bands of heavier snow moved through the Middle Atlantic States and caused wide variations in accumulations that were both location (underneath these bands) and elevation dependent.   A pocket of warm air associated with the low pressure system itself kept precipitation as rain longer across East Central New Jersey and held accumulations down.

Sussex and Warren Counties along with the northwest part of Morris County were hit the hardest.  A limited state of emergency was declared in Sussex County.  Shelters were opened in 12 municipalities.  Vernon Township within Sussex County declared a state of emergency that banned all driving.  The combination of heavy wet snow, up to around two feet in some areas, and strong winds produced numerous power outages.  GPU reported 75,000 homes lost power in Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties with the majority in Sussex County.  Full power was not restored in all areas until April 3rd.  Trees were described as being "down all over the place".  Downed trees also closed most of the major roadways in Sussex County including New Jersey State Routes 15 and 23 (closed through April. 1st) and County Roads 515 and 517. Accumulations in Sussex and Warren Counties included 26 inches at High Point, 22 inches in Wantage, 19 inches in Sussex, 18 inches in Hackettstown, 17 inches in Sparta, 15 inches in Montague and 14 inches in Washington.   

In Morris County,  the differences of location and elevation came to play with this storm.  Only 2 inches of snow accumulated in Morristown in the southeast part of the county, while 24 inches accumulated in Jefferson Township at the northwest end of the county.  During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.  In Princeton Township, about two dozen downed trees forced the closure of 10 roadways.  In Princeton Borough, one tree fell and crushed a porch. There were about twenty reports of downed trees and limbs that forced three road closures.  In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.  Accumulations included 18 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 10 inches in Willingboro (Burlington County), 9 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County),  8 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), Somerville (Somerset County) and Mercerville (Mercer County) and 6 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County).

In the rest of the state, accumulations were less as more precipitation fell as rain.  They averaged around 5 inches in Camden, Gloucester and Salem Counties, ranged between 3 and 6 inches in Western Atlantic and Cumberland Counties, and averaged around 3 inches in Middlesex, Monmouth and Western Ocean Counties.  Little if any snow accumulated from Coastal Ocean County southward.  But, wind gusts were stronger near the New Jersey Shore and power outages due to downed trees increased again.  Downed trees and limbs caused power outages in Monmouth and Ocean Counties in Howell Township, Lacey Township, Lakewood Township, Millstone Township, Tinton Falls and Wall Township.  Peak wind gusts included 71 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County),  64 mph in North Wildwood (Cape May County), 60 mph in Seaside Park (Ocean County) and 58 mph aboard the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.

During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.  In Princeton Township, about two dozen downed trees forced the closure of 10 roadways.  In Princeton Borough, one tree fell and crushed a porch. There were about twenty reports of downed trees and limbs that forced three road closures.  In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.  Accumulations included 18 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 10 inches in Willingboro (Burlington County), 9 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County),  8 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), Somerville (Somerset County) and Mercerville (Mercer County) and 6 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County).

In the rest of the state, accumulations were less as more precipitation fell as rain.  They averaged around 5 inches in Camden, Gloucester and Salem Counties, ranged between 3 and 6 inches in Western Atlantic and Cumberland Counties, and averaged around 3 inches in Middlesex, Monmouth and Western Ocean Counties.  Little if any snow accumulated from Coastal Ocean County southward.  But, wind gusts were stronger near the New Jersey Shore and power outages due to downed trees increased again.  Downed trees and limbs caused power outages in Monmouth and Ocean Counties in Howell Township, Lacey Township, Lakewood Township, Millstone Township, Tinton Falls and Wall Township.  Peak wind gusts included 71 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County),  64 mph in North Wildwood (Cape May County), 60 mph in Seaside Park (Ocean County) and 58 mph aboard the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.  The strong winds forced a reduction in the number of departures by the ferry across Delaware Bay.",252

Sussex and Warren Counties along with the northwest part of Morris County were hit the hardest.  A limited state of emergency was declared in Sussex County.  Shelters were opened in 12 municipalities.  Vernon Township within Sussex County declared a state of emergency that banned all driving.  The combination of heavy wet snow, up to around two feet in some areas, and strong winds produced numerous power outages.

In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.  Accumulations included 18 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 10 inches in Willingboro (Burlington County), 9 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County),  8 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), Somerville (Somerset County) and Mercerville (Mercer County) and 6 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County).

In the rest of the state, accumulations were less as more precipitation fell as rain.  They averaged around 5 inches in Camden, Gloucester and Salem Counties, ranged between 3 and 6 inches in Western Atlantic and Cumberland Counties, and averaged around 3 inches in Middlesex, Monmouth and Western Ocean Counties.  Little if any snow accumulated from Coastal Ocean County southward.  But, wind gusts were stronger near the New Jersey Shore and power outages due to downed trees increased again.  Downed trees and limbs caused power outages in Monmouth and Ocean Counties in Howell Township, Lacey Township, Lakewood Township, Millstone Township, Tinton Falls and Wall Township.  Peak wind gusts included 71 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County),  64 mph in North Wildwood (Cape May County), 60 mph in Seaside Park (Ocean County) and 58 mph aboard the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.  The strong winds forced a reduction in the number of departures by the ferry across Delaware Bay.",258

Sussex and Warren Counties along with the northwest part of Morris County were hit the hardest.  A limited state of emergency was declared in Sussex County.  Shelters were opened in 12 municipalities.  Vernon Township within Sussex County declared a state of emergency that banned all driving.  The combination of heavy wet snow, up to around two feet in some areas, and strong winds produced numerous power outages.  GPU reported 75,000 homes lost power in Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties with the majority in Sussex County.  Full power was not restored in all areas until April 3rd.  Trees were described as being "down all over the place".  Downed trees also closed most of the major roadways in Sussex County including New Jersey State Routes 15 and 23 (closed through April. 1st) and County Roads 515 and 517. Accumulations in Sussex and Warren Counties included 26 inches at High Point, 22 inches in Wantage, 19 inches in Sussex, 18 inches in Hackettstown, 17 inches in Sparta, 15 inches in Montague and 14 inches in Washington.   

In Morris County,  the differences of location and elevation came to play with this storm.  Only 2 inches of snow accumulated in Morristown in the southeast part of the county, while 24 inches accumulated in Jefferson Township at the northwest end of the county.  During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.

The Poconos and Western Chester County were hit the hardest.  The combination of the heavy wet snow and strong gusty winds pulled down trees and power lines and caused blowing and drifting of the snow.  It also caused major traffic accidents.  The State of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency in Carbon, Chester and Monroe Counties.  Interstates 80 and 380 were closed for up to 20 hours on March 31st and April 1st.  The National Guard sent humvees into the area to rescue stranded motorists.  In Monroe County, about 1,300 motorists spent the night of March 31st in shelters after traffic accidents and heavy snow forced the closure of Interstates 80 and 380.  While the rain changed to snow early in the day,  the problems started with the heavier snow during the afternoon.  Over 250 accidents occurred.  Near white-out conditions were reported between 8 p.m. EST on the 31st and 230 a.m. EST on the 1st.  It was estimated nearly 3,000 vehicles were stuck on roadways.  The heavy wet snow and strong winds also knocked down trees and power lines cutting off power to about 5,000 homes in the Poconos.  Accumulations included 23 inches in Mount Pocono, 18 inches in Blakeslee, 17 inches in Long Pond and 9 inches in Lehighton.  No serious injuries were reported.

In Chester County, over 300 persons took shelter overnight in a firehouse under construction in the western part of the county.  The heavy snow contributed to two traffic fatalities within the county.  At 1230 p.m. EST an 18-year-old woman passenger was killed in East Nottingham when the vehicle she was in skidded and struck a pole.   At 6 p.m. EST a 45-year-old male was killed in West Whiteland Township when his vehicle was struck by a delivery truck.  In all, the county reported about 300 traffic accidents and nearly the same number of downed trees, wires, traffic lights and abandoned cars.  Dozens of vehicles were abandoned between East Nottingham and Avondale.  Fifteen tractor trailers were disabled on Pennsylvania State Route 41 alone.  All or parts of Pennsylvania State Routes 10 and 41 and U.S. Routes 30 and 202 were closed in the county.  The Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) estimated 15,000 homes lost power in the county. Accumulations included 11 inches in Coatesville, 9 inches in Downingtown and 4 inches in Honey Brook.

This storm featured bands of heavier snow.  No place was this more apparent than in Berks County where accumulations ranged from a trace in western parts of the county to 10 inches in eastern parts of the county in Greenwich, Ruscombmanor and Union Townships.  Interstate 78 was closed overnight between exits 12 (Greenwich Township) and 13 (New Smithville in Lehigh County) because of accidents and blowing snow.  The eastbound lanes were backed up for 10 miles.  The Pennsylvania Office of Emergency Management dispatched the Red Cross to help stranded motorists with food and drinks between exits 8 and 14 on Interstate 78.  The Berks County Communication Center responded to over 50 serious accidents throughout the county between 3 and 9 p.m. EST.  The most serious one (4 injuries) was a jackknifed tractor trailer that was rammed by a car and then a moving van on Interstate 78 in Windsor Township.  GPU reported 2,500 homes lost power in the county,  nearly all in Muhlenberg Township after a large tree came crashing down.  In addition to Interstate 78, numerous accidents and road closures occurred on Pennsylvania State Routes 401, 422, 568 and 625. 
   
In the Lehigh Valley, northern parts of Northampton County were hit the hardest.  The most problems were reported in Bushkill and Moore Townships.  Accidents and/or downed trees shut down sections of Pennsylvania State Routes 33, 191, 248, 512 and 611.  Forty motorists were stranded on Airport Road, their vehicles were unable to get up the hill just south of Pennsylvania State Route 329.  At the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 4.4 inches of snow accumulated.

Elsewhere around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, rush hour was called a nightmare in Bucks County.  The southbound side of Interstate 95 was shut down for an hour because of a multi-vehicle accident.  Pennsylvania State Route 412 was also closed because of accidents.  In Montgomery County, numerous accidents were reported in Upper Pottsgrove, Worcester, Lower Pottsgrove and Lower Providence Townships.  In addition, 11,000 PECO homes lost power.  About 65,000 homes and businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area lost power because of the combination of the heavy wet snow and strong winds.  Within Philadelphia, there were over 200 trees that were damaged because of this combination.

The Poconos and Western Chester County were hit the hardest.  The combination of the heavy wet snow and strong gusty winds pulled down trees and power lines and caused blowing and drifting of the snow.  It also caused major traffic accidents.  The State of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency in Carbon, Chester and Monroe Counties.  Interstates 80 and 380 were closed for up to 20 hours on March 31st and April 1st.

While the rain changed to snow early in the day,  the problems started with the heavier snow during the afternoon.  Over 250 accidents occurred.  Near white-out conditions were reported between 8 p.m. EST on the 31st and 230 a.m. EST on the 1st.  It was estimated nearly 3,000 vehicles were stuck on roadways.  The heavy wet snow and strong winds also knocked down trees and power lines cutting off power to about 5,000 homes in the Poconos.  Accumulations included 23 inches in Mount Pocono, 18 inches in Blakeslee, 17 inches in Long Pond and 9 inches in Lehighton.  No serious injuries were reported.

In Chester County, over 300 persons took shelter overnight in a firehouse under construction in the western part of the county.  The heavy snow contributed to two traffic fatalities within the county.  At 1230 p.m. EST an 18-year-old woman passenger was killed in East Nottingham when the vehicle she was in skidded and struck a pole.   At 6 p.m. EST a 45-year-old male was killed in West Whiteland Township when his vehicle was struck by a delivery truck.  In all, the county reported about 300 traffic accidents and nearly the same number of downed trees, wires, traffic lights and abandoned cars.  Dozens of vehicles were abandoned between East Nottingham and Avondale.  Fifteen tractor trailers were disabled on Pennsylvania State Route 41 alone.  All or parts of Pennsylvania State Routes 10 and 41 and U.S. Routes 30 and 202 were closed in the county.  The Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) estimated 15,000 homes lost power in the county.

The Pennsylvania Office of Emergency Management dispatched the Red Cross to help stranded motorists with food and drinks between exits 8 and 14 on Interstate 78.  The Berks County Communication Center responded to over 50 serious accidents throughout the county between 3 and 9 p.m. EST.  The most serious one (4 injuries) was a jackknifed tractor trailer that was rammed by a car and then a moving van on Interstate 78 in Windsor Township.

Precipitation started in the form of rain and began spreading across the state from south to north during the morning hours, but soon mixed with heavy, wet snow.  Rain changed to all snow rather quickly by late morning across western and central Massachusetts and soon changed to all snow in the eastern part of the state, except right along the coast, during the afternoon.

Thunder and lightning began during the late afternoon and continued intermittently throughout the night.  

Northeast winds increased to strong to gale force throughout the eastern part of the state by late afternoon and high winds occurred during the evening, especially along coastal sections.  The strong winds with this storm occurred during the late afternoon and evening hours.  A peak gust to 73 mph from the northeast was recorded at Blue Hill in Milton at 6:43 PM.

Several fires broke out in the county; one was aided by the strong winds.  A roofer's blowtorch ignited an attic at a Darnestown home, which eventually caused over $100 thousand in damage.

In Frederick Co (MDZ004), there were at least 10 instances of trees and wires down, but no major structural damage.  A wind gust was clocked at 75 mph in Clear Spring (MDZ003), and some trees and lines were downed elsewhere in the county as well.  The winds, which continued through April 1, caused the postponement of the Baltimore Orioles baseball club's home opener.

Scattered power outages were reported in the Baltimore Gas and Electric and Potomac Electric Power (PEPCO) service areas.  PEPCO reported 3000 outages, most in Prince Georges County (MDZ013).",341

The gusty winds forced the closure of the Washington Monument for two days during the peak of the spring tourist season, and also blew away the famed Japanese cherry blossoms a full week before the festival and parade.  An airliner on approach to Washington/National Airport was forced to divert to Washington/Dulles after twice aborting a landing.

Along the Anacostia River, a 19th-century barge was uncovered as the northwest winds aided an anomalously low tide.  On land, a portion of brick wall was destroyed at the Capital Children's Museum.",342

An elderly woman (over 70 years of age) was blown down and sustained head lacerations, requiring a brief hospital stay.  A town home under construction was damaged.  A large oak tree, at least 15 feet in diameter, was uprooted, totalling a nearby automobile.  Several trees in its path were damaged, and a portion of the tree fell onto a home.  Another uprooted tree destroyed a deck along South Sixth Street.  A roof facing was blown off an office building along Wilson Blvd, causing damage to several nearby automobiles.

The low pressure system responsible for this looked rather innocuous on March 30th as it moved with its associated cold front through the Midwest.  Temperatures that day (Easter Sunday) warmed into the 70s across most of Delaware.  But as the low intensified off the New Jersey Coast on March 31st,  it pulled down colder air.  The heavy precipitation it created also cooled the atmosphere and changed the rain over to snow at times of heavier precipitation bursts in the northern half of the state from the afternoon of March 31st into the early morning of April 1st.  These bands of heavier snow moved through the Middle Atlantic States and caused wide variations in accumulations that were both location (underneath these bands) and elevation dependent.  One such band affected the northwest part of New Castle County where accumulations exceeded five inches. Less snow (3 to 4 inches on average) accumulated farther southeast including the city of Wilmington.   

Strong northwest winds on both March 31st and April 1st caused some blowing and drifting of the snow in northwest New Castle County.  In addition, the weight of the heavy, wet snow tore down tree limbs and produced scattered power outages.  Very little snow accumulated farther south in Delaware, but gusty northwest winds that circulated around the low pressure system buffeted the state for two days.  The peak wind gust at the New Castle County Airport was 43 mph, but stronger gusts occurred farther south.  A wind gust of 58 mph was recorded by the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.  The strong winds also pulled down power lines and caused scattered outages in Sussex County and isolated outages in Kent County.

Trees were described as being "down all over the place".  Downed trees also closed most of the major roadways in Sussex County including New Jersey State Routes 15 and 23 (closed through April. 1st) and County Roads 515 and 517. Accumulations in Sussex and Warren Counties included 26 inches at High Point, 22 inches in Wantage, 19 inches in Sussex, 18 inches in Hackettstown, 17 inches in Sparta, 15 inches in Montague and 14 inches in Washington.   

In Morris County,  the differences of location and elevation came to play with this storm.  Only 2 inches of snow accumulated in Morristown in the southeast part of the county, while 24 inches accumulated in Jefferson Township at the northwest end of the county.  During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.  In Princeton Township, about two dozen downed trees forced the closure of 10 roadways.  In Princeton Borough, one tree fell and crushed a porch. There were about twenty reports of downed trees and limbs that forced three road closures.  In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.  Accumulations included 18 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 10 inches in Willingboro (Burlington County), 9 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County),  8 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), Somerville (Somerset County) and Mercerville (Mercer County) and 6 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County).

In the rest of the state, accumulations were less as more precipitation fell as rain.  They averaged around 5 inches in Camden, Gloucester and Salem Counties, ranged between 3 and 6 inches in Western Atlantic and Cumberland Counties, and averaged around 3 inches in Middlesex, Monmouth and Western Ocean Counties.  Little if any snow accumulated from Coastal Ocean County southward.  But, wind gusts were stronger near the New Jersey Shore and power outages due to downed trees increased again.  Downed trees and limbs caused power outages in Monmouth and Ocean Counties in Howell Township, Lacey Township, Lakewood Township, Millstone Township, Tinton Falls and Wall Township.  Peak wind gusts included 71 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County),  64 mph in North Wildwood (Cape May County), 60 mph in Seaside Park (Ocean County) and 58 mph aboard the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.

The heavy precipitation it created also cooled the atmosphere and changed the rain over to snow.    The rain changed to snow close to dawn across extreme Northwest New Jersey.  The changeover progressed southeast reaching the rest of Northwest New Jersey around 9 a.m. EST and the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area close to noon EST.

Sussex and Warren Counties along with the northwest part of Morris County were hit the hardest.  A limited state of emergency was declared in Sussex County.  Shelters were opened in 12 municipalities.  Vernon Township within Sussex County declared a state of emergency that banned all driving.  The combination of heavy wet snow, up to around two feet in some areas, and strong winds produced numerous power outages.  GPU reported 75,000 homes lost power in Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties with the majority in Sussex County.  Full power was not restored in all areas until April 3rd.  Trees were described as being "down all over the place".  Downed trees also closed most of the major roadways in Sussex County including New Jersey State Routes 15 and 23 (closed through April. 1st) and County Roads 515 and 517. Accumulations in Sussex and Warren Counties included 26 inches at High Point, 22 inches in Wantage, 19 inches in Sussex, 18 inches in Hackettstown, 17 inches in Sparta, 15 inches in Montague and 14 inches in Washington.   

In Morris County,  the differences of location and elevation came to play with this storm.  Only 2 inches of snow accumulated in Morristown in the southeast part of the county, while 24 inches accumulated in Jefferson Township at the northwest end of the county.  During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.  In Princeton Township, about two dozen downed trees forced the closure of 10 roadways.  In Princeton Borough, one tree fell and crushed a porch. There were about twenty reports of downed trees and limbs that forced three road closures.  In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.

Sussex and Warren Counties along with the northwest part of Morris County were hit the hardest.  A limited state of emergency was declared in Sussex County.  Shelters were opened in 12 municipalities.  Vernon Township within Sussex County declared a state of emergency that banned all driving.  The combination of heavy wet snow, up to around two feet in some areas, and strong winds produced numerous power outages.  GPU reported 75,000 homes lost power in Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties with the majority in Sussex County.  Full power was not restored in all areas until April 3rd.  Trees were described as being "down all over the place".  Downed trees also closed most of the major roadways in Sussex County including New Jersey State Routes 15 and 23 (closed through April. 1st) and County Roads 515 and 517. Accumulations in Sussex and Warren Counties included 26 inches at High Point, 22 inches in Wantage, 19 inches in Sussex, 18 inches in Hackettstown, 17 inches in Sparta, 15 inches in Montague and 14 inches in Washington.   

In Morris County,  the differences of location and elevation came to play with this storm.  Only 2 inches of snow accumulated in Morristown in the southeast part of the county, while 24 inches accumulated in Jefferson Township at the northwest end of the county.  During the storm U.S. Route 46 was described as a parking lot.  Heavy wet snow downed trees and at least damaged one home within Kinnelon Borough.  Strong gusty winds and the heavy wet snow continued to cause problems on April 1st even after the snow ended as downed trees closed U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey State Route 24 for several hours.  Other accumulations within the county included 15 inches in Long Valley, Mount Arlington and Mount Olive and 14 inches in Rockaway.

In West Central New Jersey, accumulations were generally less.  But several bands of heavier snow brought season high accumulations to sections of Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer and Burlington Counties.  While there were less road closures, the combination of wind and heavy wet snow did cause an additional 34,000 homes and businesses within Public Service Electric and Gas's service area to lose power.  About 25,000 of the outages were centered in Princeton and nearby communities.  All power was restored by the evening of the 1st.  In Princeton Township, about two dozen downed trees forced the closure of 10 roadways.  In Princeton Borough, one tree fell and crushed a porch. There were about twenty reports of downed trees and limbs that forced three road closures.  In Somerset County, Bernardsville was hit the hardest with up to 30 trees down that forced 6 road closures.  Accumulations included 18 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 10 inches in Willingboro (Burlington County), 9 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County),  8 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), Somerville (Somerset County) and Mercerville (Mercer County) and 6 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County).

The storm produced the greatest snowfall on record for any storm at Worcester Municipal Airport, with a total of 33 inches.  It was the third greatest snowfall on record at Boston with an accumulation of 25.4 inches.  The Blue Hill Observatory in Milton recorded 29 inches in 24 hours, establishing an all-time record and the storm total there of 30 inches made it the third greatest snowstorm on record.  

Two to five inches of liquid equivalent precipitation made this snowfall extremely heavy and difficult to remove.   The weight of the snow resulted in severe damage to trees and power lines and up to 750,000 electric customers lost power statewide during the height of the storm in the early morning hours of April 1st.  Whole towns were without power for up to three days after the storm.  More then 100 power crews were brought in from states outside of New England to help restore power.  The governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts declared a state of emergency,  The City of Boston, which recorded 25.4 inches of snow,  was paralyzed for two days and the National Guard was called in to help with snow removal.  Boston's Logan International Airport was closed for one day.  

A porch roof collapsed under the weight of the heavy snow in the Dorchester section of Boston, injuring one person.  Several roofs collapsed in communities south of  Boston, including the roof of a warehouse in Randolph, where damage was estimated at $20,000.  A roof collapse was reported at an automobile dealership in Norwell.  Ten greenhouses buckled under the weight of the snow in Randolph.  At  least four plastic, inflatable domes covering indoor tennis courts in Boston collapsed under the weight of the heavy snow.  Dozens more were damaged across the state.  Hundreds of cars and trailer trucks were abandoned on state highways, making plowing operations very difficult.  More than 40 trailer trucks were stuck on Route 128 between Newton and Canton.  The cost of snow removal was estimated to cost the state highway department between $6,000,000 and $7,000,000.

The Poconos and Western Chester County were hit the hardest.  The combination of the heavy wet snow and strong gusty winds pulled down trees and power lines and caused blowing and drifting of the snow.  It also caused major traffic accidents.  The State of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency in Carbon, Chester and Monroe Counties.  Interstates 80 and 380 were closed for up to 20 hours on March 31st and April 1st.  The National Guard sent humvees into the area to rescue stranded motorists.  In Monroe County, about 1,300 motorists spent the night of March 31st in shelters after traffic accidents and heavy snow forced the closure of Interstates 80 and 380.  While the rain changed to snow early in the day,  the problems started with the heavier snow during the afternoon.  Over 250 accidents occurred.  Near white-out conditions were reported between 8 p.m. EST on the 31st and 230 a.m. EST on the 1st.  It was estimated nearly 3,000 vehicles were stuck on roadways.  The heavy wet snow and strong winds also knocked down trees and power lines cutting off power to about 5,000 homes in the Poconos.  Accumulations included 23 inches in Mount Pocono, 18 inches in Blakeslee, 17 inches in Long Pond and 9 inches in Lehighton.  No serious injuries were reported.

In Chester County, over 300 persons took shelter overnight in a firehouse under construction in the western part of the county.  The heavy snow contributed to two traffic fatalities within the county.  At 1230 p.m. EST an 18-year-old woman passenger was killed in East Nottingham when the vehicle she was in skidded and struck a pole.   At 6 p.m. EST a 45-year-old male was killed in West Whiteland Township when his vehicle was struck by a delivery truck.  In all, the county reported about 300 traffic accidents and nearly the same number of downed trees, wires, traffic lights and abandoned cars.  Dozens of vehicles were abandoned between East Nottingham and Avondale.  Fifteen tractor trailers were disabled on Pennsylvania State Route 41 alone.  All or parts of Pennsylvania State Routes 10 and 41 and U.S. Routes 30 and 202 were closed in the county.  The Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) estimated 15,000 homes lost power in the county. Accumulations included 11 inches in Coatesville, 9 inches in Downingtown and 4 inches in Honey Brook.

This storm featured bands of heavier snow.  No place was this more apparent than in Berks County where accumulations ranged from a trace in western parts of the county to 10 inches in eastern parts of the county in Greenwich, Ruscombmanor and Union Townships.  Interstate 78 was closed overnight between exits 12 (Greenwich Township) and 13 (New Smithville in Lehigh County) because of accidents and blowing snow.  The eastbound lanes were backed up for 10 miles.  The Pennsylvania Office of Emergency Management dispatched the Red Cross to help stranded motorists with food and drinks between exits 8 and 14 on Interstate 78.  The Berks County Communication Center responded to over 50 serious accidents throughout the county between 3 and 9 p.m. EST.  The most serious one (4 injuries) was a jackknifed tractor trailer that was rammed by a car and then a moving van on Interstate 78 in Windsor Township.  GPU reported 2,500 homes lost power in the county,  nearly all in Muhlenberg Township after a large tree came crashing down.  In addition to Interstate 78, numerous accidents and road closures occurred on Pennsylvania State Routes 401, 422, 568 and 625. 
   
In the Lehigh Valley, northern parts of Northampton County were hit the hardest.  The most problems were reported in Bushkill and Moore Townships.  Accidents and/or downed trees shut down sections of Pennsylvania State Routes 33, 191, 248, 512 and 611.  Forty motorists were stranded on Airport Road, their vehicles were unable to get up the hill just south of Pennsylvania State Route 329.  At the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 4.4 inches of snow accumulated.

Elsewhere around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, rush hour was called a nightmare in Bucks County.  The southbound side of Interstate 95 was shut down for an hour because of a multi-vehicle accident.  Pennsylvania State Route 412 was also closed because of accidents.  In Montgomery County, numerous accidents were reported in Upper Pottsgrove, Worcester, Lower Pottsgrove and Lower Providence Townships.  In addition, 11,000 PECO homes lost power.  About 65,000 homes and businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area lost power because of the combination of the heavy wet snow and strong winds.  Within Philadelphia, there were over 200 trees that were damaged because of this combination.  Accumulations included 12 inches in Furlong, 11 inches in Sellersville and Palm, 10 inches in Green Lane,  9 inches in Neshaminy Falls,  8 inches in Pottstown and Perkasie,  5 inches in Levittown, 3.9 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport and 3 inches at Valley Forge.

Accidents and/or downed trees shut down sections of Pennsylvania State Routes 33, 191, 248, 512 and 611.  Forty motorists were stranded on Airport Road, their vehicles were unable to get up the hill just south of Pennsylvania State Route 329.  At the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 4.4 inches of snow accumulated.

Elsewhere around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, rush hour was called a nightmare in Bucks County.  The southbound side of Interstate 95 was shut down for an hour because of a multi-vehicle accident.  Pennsylvania State Route 412 was also closed because of accidents.  In Montgomery County, numerous accidents were reported in Upper Pottsgrove, Worcester, Lower Pottsgrove and Lower Providence Townships.  In addition, 11,000 PECO homes lost power.  About 65,000 homes and businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area lost power because of the combination of the heavy wet snow and strong winds.  Within Philadelphia, there were over 200 trees that were damaged because of this combination.  Accumulations included 12 inches in Furlong, 11 inches in Sellersville and Palm, 10 inches in Green Lane,  9 inches in Neshaminy Falls,  8 inches in Pottstown and Perkasie,  5 inches in Levittown, 3.9 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport and 3 inches at Valley Forge.

While the snow was over by daybreak on April 1st, strong gusty winds persisted throughout the daylight hours hampering utility and road crew work.  The strongest wind gusts averaged around 45 mph throughout the region.",427

The changeover progressed southeast reaching the Lehigh Valley around 9 a.m. EST and Philadelphia close to noon EST.  Bands of heavier snow moved through the Middle Atlantic States and caused wide variations in accumulations that were both location (underneath these bands) and elevation dependent.  

The Poconos and Western Chester County were hit the hardest.  The combination of the heavy wet snow and strong gusty winds pulled down trees and power lines and caused blowing and drifting of the snow.  It also caused major traffic accidents.  The State of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency in Carbon, Chester and Monroe Counties.  Interstates 80 and 380 were closed for up to 20 hours on March 31st and April 1st.  The National Guard sent humvees into the area to rescue stranded motorists.  In Monroe County, about 1,300 motorists spent the night of March 31st in shelters after traffic accidents and heavy snow forced the closure of Interstates 80 and 380.  While the rain changed to snow early in the day,  the problems started with the heavier snow during the afternoon.  Over 250 accidents occurred.  Near white-out conditions were reported between 8 p.m. EST on the 31st and 230 a.m. EST on the 1st.  It was estimated nearly 3,000 vehicles were stuck on roadways.  The heavy wet snow and strong winds also knocked down trees and power lines cutting off power to about 5,000 homes in the Poconos.  Accumulations included 23 inches in Mount Pocono, 18 inches in Blakeslee, 17 inches in Long Pond and 9 inches in Lehighton.  No serious injuries were reported.

In Chester County, over 300 persons took shelter overnight in a firehouse under construction in the western part of the county.  The heavy snow contributed to two traffic fatalities within the county.  At 1230 p.m. EST an 18-year-old woman passenger was killed in East Nottingham when the vehicle she was in skidded and struck a pole.   At 6 p.m. EST a 45-year-old male was killed in West Whiteland Township when his vehicle was struck by a delivery truck.  In all, the county reported about 300 traffic accidents and nearly the same number of downed trees, wires, traffic lights and abandoned cars.  Dozens of vehicles were abandoned between East Nottingham and Avondale.  Fifteen tractor trailers were disabled on Pennsylvania State Route 41 alone.  All or parts of Pennsylvania State Routes 10 and 41 and U.S. Routes 30 and 202 were closed in the county.  The Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) estimated 15,000 homes lost power in the county. Accumulations included 11 inches in Coatesville, 9 inches in Downingtown and 4 inches in Honey Brook.

This storm featured bands of heavier snow.  No place was this more apparent than in Berks County where accumulations ranged from a trace in western parts of the county to 10 inches in eastern parts of the county in Greenwich, Ruscombmanor and Union Townships.  Interstate 78 was closed overnight between exits 12 (Greenwich Township) and 13 (New Smithville in Lehigh County) because of accidents and blowing snow.  The eastbound lanes were backed up for 10 miles.  The Pennsylvania Office of Emergency Management dispatched the Red Cross to help stranded motorists with food and drinks between exits 8 and 14 on Interstate 78.  The Berks County Communication Center responded to over 50 serious accidents throughout the county between 3 and 9 p.m. EST.  The most serious one (4 injuries) was a jackknifed tractor trailer that was rammed by a car and then a moving van on Interstate 78 in Windsor Township.  GPU reported 2,500 homes lost power in the county,  nearly all in Muhlenberg Township after a large tree came crashing down.

This system retreated to the south during the early morning hours of April 1st, pulling in cold air from the north.  The center then moved slowly eastward.  Heavy snow and strong winds produced blizzard and near-blizzard conditions across most of Rhode Island during the early morning hours on April 1st.  

Snowfall accumulations set all-time records for April across most of the state, with amounts ranging from around 4 inches along the south coast to nearly 30 inches along the Massachusetts border in the extreme northern portion of the state.  Some totals included:  Burrillville, 30.5 inches; West Cranston, Cumberland, and North Foster, 24 inches; downtown Providence, 19.5 inches; and Warwick, 18 inches, a new all-time record for the month of April.

The low pressure system responsible for this looked rather innocuous on March 30th as it moved with its associated cold front through the Midwest.  Temperatures that day (Easter Sunday) warmed into the 70s across most of Delaware.  But as the low intensified off the New Jersey Coast on March 31st,  it pulled down colder air.  The heavy precipitation it created also cooled the atmosphere and changed the rain over to snow at times of heavier precipitation bursts in the northern half of the state from the afternoon of March 31st into the early morning of April 1st.  These bands of heavier snow moved through the Middle Atlantic States and caused wide variations in accumulations that were both location (underneath these bands) and elevation dependent.  One such band affected the northwest part of New Castle County where accumulations exceeded five inches. Less snow (3 to 4 inches on average) accumulated farther southeast including the city of Wilmington.   

Strong northwest winds on both March 31st and April 1st caused some blowing and drifting of the snow in northwest New Castle County.  In addition, the weight of the heavy, wet snow tore down tree limbs and produced scattered power outages.  Very little snow accumulated farther south in Delaware, but gusty northwest winds that circulated around the low pressure system buffeted the state for two days.  The peak wind gust at the New Castle County Airport was 43 mph, but stronger gusts occurred farther south.  A wind gust of 58 mph was recorded by the Cape May/Lewes Ferry.  The strong winds also pulled down power lines and caused scattered outages in Sussex County and isolated outages in Kent County.  The very strong winds also forced the Cape May/Lewes Ferry to reduce their number of trips across Delaware Bay.",438

Four small tornadoes were confirmed:  one in northern Shenandoah Co near the town of Wheatfield, one in extreme southeast Frederick Co in the community of Double Tollgate, a third in Clarke Co near the town of Berryville, and a fourth in Loudoun Co between Mountville and Oatlands.

Damage in Wheatfield was confined to a heavily wooded rural area, where 20 trees were snapped or uprooted along a narrow but distinctive path.  Winds were estimated to be around 80 mph.  It was the first tornado ever reported in the county; perhaps partially due to a NWS survey team locating the damage.  The twister lifted along the county line, later seen as a funnel near Stephens City (Frederick Co)  before dissipating.  The second small tornado touched down east of Klines Corner in southeast Frederick Co.  Five trees were downed on one farm, and damage was spotty along a 3-mile path to Double Church Road just southwest of Double Tollgate.  A spotter had previously reported a touchdown near this area.  Most of the damage was to trees, though some minor roof and fence damage was observed along and near Double Church Road.

In Clarke Co, a third tornado touched down just south of Berryville.  Minor damage was noted to a roof and shingles at a house; an electric garage door was damaged as well.  A  circular pattern was noted in the tall grass and in branches that had broken off nearby trees.  Some tomato stakes and cages were pulled up and tossed.  A fourth (small) tornado path was found from Mountville to Oatlands in western Loudoun Co.  Large branches were snapped and some trees were uprooted on a narrow path along Lime Kiln Road.

Scattered tree damage was noted elsewhere across the six-county area, including the towns of Reliance (Warren Co), Middletown and Stephens City (Frederick Co), Upperville (Fauquier Co),  White Post and Berrys (Clarke Co), and from Middleburg to Arcola (Loudoun).

Farther east, a steel-framed fire hall, still under construction, collapsed when a near-severe thunderstorm wind gust passed through Sterling (Loudoun Co).  Approximately 150 wooden trusses supporting the frame initially fell.  A home in the nearby Cascades subdivision had a deck collapse.  However, the deck was found to have been improperly anchored to the ground  (e.g., not according to specifications).  Based on the above evidence, and the fact that only two small trees were reported down near the fire center, wind speeds were estimated to be just under severe criteria.
